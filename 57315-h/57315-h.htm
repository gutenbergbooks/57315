<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> lectures which appear in this volume were delivered
at the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia,
in the early months of 1890. They have since been written
out, and references added in the foot-notes to a number
of works and articles, which will enable the student to
pursue his readings on any point in which he may be interested.
My endeavor has been to present the results of
the latest and most accurate researches on the subjects
treated; though no one can be better aware than myself
that in compressing such an extensive science into so
limited a space, I have often necessarily been superficial.
It is some excuse for the publication, if one is needed,
that I am not aware of any other recent work upon this
science written in the English language.</p>

<p>That no two persons are identical in appearance is
such a truism that we are apt to overlook its significance.
The parent can rarely be recognized from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
the traits of the child, the brother from those of the
sister, the family from its members.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the individual peculiarities become
lost in those of the race. It is a common statement
that to our eyes all Chinamen look alike, or that
one cannot distinguish an Indian “buck” from a
“squaw.” Yet you recognize very well the one as a
Chinaman, the other as an Indian. The traits of the
race thus overslaugh the variable characters of the
family, the sex or the individual, and maintain themselves
uniform and unalterable in the pure blood of
the stock through all experience.</p>

<p>This fact is the corner-stone of the science of Ethnography,
whose aim is to study the differences, physical
and mental, between men <i>in masses</i>, and ascertain
which of these differences are least variable and hence
of most value in classifying the human species into its
several natural varieties or types.</p>

<p>In daily life and current literature the existence of
such varieties is fully recognized. The European and
African, or White and Black races, are those most
familiar to us; but the American Indian and the Mongolian
are not rare, and are recognized also as distinct
from each other and ourselves. These common terms
for the races are not quite accurate; but they illustrate
a tendency to identify the most prominent types of the
species with the great continental areas, and in this I
shall show that the popular judgment is in accord with
scientific reasoning.</p>

<p>If an ordinary observer were asked what the traits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
are which fix the racial type in his mind, he would
certainly omit many which are highly esteemed by the
man of science. He would have nothing to say, for
instance, about the internal structures or organs, because
they are not visible; but in approaching the subject
from a scientific direction, we must lay most
stress upon these, as their peculiarities decide the external
traits which strike the eye.</p>

<p>Nor does the casual observer note the mental or
physical differences which exist between the races
whom he recognizes; yet these are not less permanent
and not less important than those which concern
the physical economy only. In both these directions
the student of ethnography as a science must pursue
careful researches.</p>

<p>In the present lecture I shall pass in review the
physical elements held to be most weighty in the discrimination
of racial types; and, first, those relating to</p>

<p><i>The Bones.</i>&mdash;Most important are the measurements
of the skull, that science called <i>craniology</i>, or <i>craniometry</i>.</p>

<p>Ethnologists who are merely anatomists have made
too much of this science. They have applied it to the
exclusion of other elements, and have given it a prominence
which it does not deserve. The shape of the
skull is no distinction of race in the individual; only in
the mass, in the average of large numbers, has it importance.
Even here its value is not racial. Within
the limits of the same people, as among the Slavonians,
for example, the most different skulls are found,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
and even the pure-blood natives of some small islands
in the Pacific Ocean present widely various forms.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Experiments on the lower animals prove that the
skull is easily moulded by trifling causes. Darwin
found that he could produce long, or short, or non-symmetrical
skulls in rabbits by training.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The shape
also bears a relation to stature. As a general rule
short men have short or rounded heads, tall men have
long heads. The longest skulled nation in Europe
are the Norwegians, who are also the tallest; the
roundest are the Auvergnats, who, of all the European
whites, are the shortest.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, employed cautiously, in large averages,
and with a careful regard for all the other ethnic
elements, the measurements of the skull are extremely
useful as accessory data of comparison.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>Some craniologists have run up these measurements
to more than a hundred; but those worth mentioning
in this connection are but few. There is, first, the
proportion which the length of the head has to its
breadth. This makes the distinction between long,
medium and broad skulls, “dolicho-cephalic,” “meso-cephalic,”
and “brachy-cephalic.” In the medium
skull the transverse bears to the longitudinal diameter
the proportion of about 80:100. The proportion
75:100 would make quite a long skull, and 85:100
quite a broad skull, the extreme variations not exceeding
70:100-90:100. (Figs. 1 and 2.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_001" src="images/fig_001.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 1 and 2.</span>&mdash;Long and Short Skulls.</p></div>

<p>The Asiatic race or typical Mongolians are generally
brachy-cephalic, the Eskimos and African negroes
dolicho-cephalic; while the whites of Europe and
American Indians present great diversity.</p>

<p>The lengthening of the skull may be anteriorly or
posteriorly, and this is probably more significant of
brain power than its width. In the black race the
lengthening is occipital, that is at the rear, indicating
a preponderance of the lower mental powers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_003" src="images/fig_003.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Lines of Sutures in the Skull.</p></div>

<p>The height of the skull is another measurement
which is much respected by craniologists; but they
are far from agreed as to the points from which the
lines shall be drawn, so that it is difficult to compare
their results.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The “sutures,” or lines of union between
the several bones of the skull, present indications
of great value. In the lower races they are
much simpler than in the higher, and they become
obliterated earlier in life; the bones of the skull thus
uniting into a compact mass and preventing further
expansion of the cavity occupied by the brain.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> (Fig.
3.) Occasionally small separated bones are found in
these sutures, more frequently in some races than in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
others. One of these, toward the back of the head,
occurs so constantly in certain American tribes that it
has been named the “Inca bone.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>In many savage tribes there are artificial deformations
of the skull, which render it useless as a means
of comparison. The “Flathead Indians” are an example,
and many Peruvian skulls are thus pressed out
of shape. It is singular that this violence to such an
important organ does not seem to be attended with
any injurious result on the intellectual powers.</p>

<p>The orbit of the eyes is another feature which varies
in races. The proportion of the short to the long
diameter furnishes what is known as the “orbital index.”
The Mongolians present nearest a circular
orbit, the proportion being sometimes 93:100; while
the lowest range has been found in skulls from ancient
French cemeteries, presenting an index of 61:100.
The latter are technically called “microsemes;” the
former “megasemes,” while the mean are “mesosemes.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>In a similar manner the aperture of the nostrils
varies and constitutes quite an important element of
comparison known as the “nasal index.” Where this
aperture is narrow, the nose is thin and prominent;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
when broad, the nose is large and flat. The former
are “leptorhinian,” the latter “platyrhinian,” while
the medium size is “mesorhinian.” This division coincides
closely with that of the chief races. Almost
all the white race are leptorhinian, the negroes platyrhinian,
the true Asiatics mesorhinian. The Eskimos
have the narrowest nasal aperture, the Bushmen the
widest.</p>

<p>The projection of the maxillaries, or upper and
lower jaws, beyond the line of the face, is a highly
significant trait. When well marked it forms the
“prognathic,” when slight the “orthognathic” type.
It is much more observable in the black than in the
white race, and is more pronounced in the old than in
the young. It is considered to correspond to a
stronger development of the merely animal instincts.</p>

<p>The relation of the lower to the upper part of the
head is measured mainly by two angles, the one the
“maxillary,” the other the “facial” angle. The
former is the angle subtended by lines drawn from the
most projecting portion of the maxillaries to the most
prominent points of the forehead above and the chin
below. (The angle M G S in the accompanying diagram,
Fig. 4.) This supplies data for two important
elements, the prognathism and the prominence of the
chin. The latter is an essential feature of man.
None of the lower animals possesses a true chin, while
man is never without one. The more acute the maxillary
angle, the less of chin is there, and the more
prognathic the subject. The averages run as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Lines and angles of skull measurement.</p></div>

<p>The facial angle is that subtended by the same line,
from the most prominent point of the upper jaw to
the most prominent part of the forehead, and a second
line drawn horizontally through the center of the aperture
of the ear. (The lines M G, D N.) It expresses
the relative prominence of the forehead and
capacity of the anterior portion of the brain. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
more acute this angle, the lower is the brain capacity.
The following are its averages:</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>The amount of brain matter contained in a skull is
called its “cerebral or cranial capacity.” This is
proved by investigation to average less in the dark
than in the light races, and in the same race less in the
female than in the male sex. Estimated in cubic centimetres
the extremes are about 1250 cub. cent. in the
Australians and Bushmen to 1600 cub. cent. in well-developed
Europeans. We cannot regard this measurement
as a constant exponent of intellectual power,
as many men with small brains have possessed fine
intellects; but as a general feature it certainly is indicative
of brain weight, and therefore of relative intelligence.
The average human brain weighs 48 ounces,
while that of a large gorilla is not over 20 ounces.</p>

<p>The <i>teeth</i> offer several points of difference in races.
In the negro they are unusually white and strong, and
in nearly all the black people (Australians, Soudanese,
Melanesians, etc.), the “wisdom teeth” are generally
furnished with three separate fangs, and are sound,
while among whites they have only two fangs, and
decay early. The most ancient jaws exhumed in
Europe present the former character. The prominence
of the canine teeth is a peculiarity of some
tribes, while in others the canines are not conical, but
resemble the incisors.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>The <i>size</i> of the teeth has also been asserted to be
an index of race, and an effort has been made to classify
peoples into small-toothed (microdonts), medium-toothed
(mesodonts), and large-toothed (megadonts).<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
But this scheme includes in the first mentioned
class the Polynesians with the Europeans, and
in the second the African negro with the Chinese,
which looks as if the plan has little value.</p>

<p>The milk-teeth have a much closer resemblance to
those of the apes than the second dentition, and some
naturalists have thought that the forms of the second
teeth point often to reversion and are characteristic
of races, but this has not been proved.</p>

<p>The teeth and the period of dentition have been
studied in man with the view to show that certain
races more than others retain the dental forms of the
lower animals, but the latest investigations go rather
to overthrow than to support these theories.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Turning to the other bones of the skeleton, I shall
note a few peculiarities said to be ethnic. The skeleton
of a negro usually presents iliac bones more vertical
than those of a white man, and the basin is narrower.
This peculiarity is measured by what is called
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
the “pelvic index,” by which is meant the ratio of the
transverse to the longitudinal diameter. The average
ratio is about 90 or 95 to 100.</p>

<p>Another trait of a lower osteology is the unusual
length of the arms. This is found to depend upon the
relative elongation of the fore-arm and its principal
bones, the radius and ulna. From comparisons which
have been instituted between the negro and the white,
it appears that the proportionate length of their arms
is as 78 to 72. The long arms are characteristic of
the higher apes and the unripe fetus, and belong,
therefore, to a lower phase of development than that
reached by the white race.</p>

<p>There is also a peculiarity among many lower peoples
in the shape of the shin-bone or tibia. Usually
when cut in cross-section, the ends present a triangular
surface; but in certain tribes, and in some ancient
remains from the caves, the cross-section is elliptical,
showing that the tibia has been flattened (platycnemic).
This was long regarded as a sign of ethnic inferiority,
but of late years the opinion of anatomists has undergone
a change, and they attribute it to the special use
of some of the muscles of the leg.</p>

<p>The heel-bone, the os calcis or calcaneum, is currently
believed to be longer and project further backward
in the negro than in the white man. There is
no doubt of the projection of the heel, and it is typical
of the true negro race, but it does not seem to be
owing to the size of the bone, as an examination of a
series of calcanca in both races proves. The lengthening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
is apparent only, and is due to the smallness of
the calf and the slenderness of the main tendon, the
“tendon of Achilles,” immediately above the heel.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>With the pithecoid forms of the bones is often associated
another simian mark. The line in the hand
known to chiromancy as the “heart” line, in all races
but the negro ceases at the base of the middle finger,
but in his race, as in the ape, it often extends quite
across the palm.</p>

<p>The bones offer the most enduring, but not the most
obvious distinctions of races. The latter are unquestionably
those presented by</p>

<p><i>The Color.</i>&mdash;This it is which first strikes the eye,
and from which the most familiar names of the types
have been drawn. The black and white, the yellow,
the red and the brown races, are terms far older than
the science of ethnography, and have always been
employed in its terminology.</p>

<p>Why it is that these different hues should indelibly
mark whole races, is not entirely explained. The
pigment or coloring matter of the skin is deposited
from the capillaries on the surface of the dermis or
true skin, and beneath the epidermis or scarf skin.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> I
have seen a negro so badly scalded that the latter was
detached in large fragments, and with it came most of
his color, leaving the spot a dirty light brown.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>The coloration of the negro, however, extends much
beyond the skin. It is found in a less degree on all
his mucous membrane, in his muscles, and even in
the pia mater and the grey substance of his brain.</p>

<p>The effort has been made to measure the colors of
different peoples by a color scale. One such was devised
by Broca, presenting over thirty shades, and
another by Dr. Radde, in Germany; but on long
journeys, or as furnished by different manufacturers,
these scales undergo changes in the shades, so that
they have not proved of the value anticipated.</p>

<p>As to the physiological cause of color, you know that
the direct action of the sun on the skin is to stimulate
the capillary action, and lead to an increased
deposit of pigment, which we call “tan.” This
pigment is largely carbon, a chemical element, principally
excreted by the lungs in the form of carbonic
oxide. When from any cause, such as a peculiar diet,
or a congenital disproportion of lungs to liver, the
carbonic oxide is less rapidly thrown off by the former
organs, there will be an increased tendency to pigmentary
deposit on the skin. This is visibly the fact
in the African blacks, whose livers are larger in proportion
to their lungs than in any other race.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>While all the truly black tribes dwell in or near the
tropics, all the arctic dwellers are dark, as the Lapps,
Samoyeds and Eskimos; therefore, it is not climate
alone which has to do with the change. The Americans
differ little in color among themselves from what
part soever of the continent they come, and the Mongolians,
though many have lived time immemorial in
the cold and temperate zone, are never really white
when of unmixed descent.</p>

<p>A practical scale for the colors of the skin is the
following:</p>

  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3" class="nowrap">Dark.</td>
    <td>{1. Black.</td>
  </tr>

<p>The color of the <i>eyes</i> should next have attention.
Their hue is very characteristic of races and of families.
Light eyes with dark skins are rare exceptions.
Other things equal, they are lighter in men than in
women. Extensive statistics have been collected in
Europe to ascertain the prevalence of certain colors,
and instructive results have been obtained.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> The division
usually adopted is into dark and light eyes.

<p>The eye must be examined at some little distance
so as to catch the total effect.</p>

<p>Next in the order of prominence is</p>

<p><i>The Hair.</i>&mdash;Indeed, Haeckel and others have based
upon its character the main divisions of mankind.
That of some races is straight, of others more or less
curled. This difference depends upon the shape of the
hairs in cross-section. The more closely they assimilate
true cylinders, the straighter they hang; while the
flatter they are, the more they approach the appearance
of wool. (Fig. 5.) The variation of the two diameters
(transverse and longitudinal) is from 25:100 to 90:100.
The straightest is found among the Malayans and
Mongolians; the wooliest among the Hottentots, Papuas
and African negroes. The white race is intermediate,
with curly or wavy hair. It is noteworthy
that all woolly-haired peoples have also long, narrow
heads and protruding jaws.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_005" src="images/fig_005.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.&mdash;Cross Sections of Hairs.</p></div>

<p>The amount of hair on the face and body is also a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
point of some moment. As a rule, the American and
Mongolian peoples have little, the Europeans and
Australians abundance. Crossing of races seems to
strengthen its growth, and the Ainos of the Japanese
Archipelago, a mixed people, are probably the hairiest
of the species. The strongest growth on the head is
seen among the Cafusos of Brazil, a hybrid of the Indian
and negro.</p>

<p><i>The Muscular Structure.</i>&mdash;The development of the
muscular structure offers notable differences in the
various races. The blacks, both in Africa and elsewhere,
have the gastrocnemii or calf muscles of the
leg very slightly developed; while in both them and
the Mongolians the facial muscles have their fibres
more closely interwoven than the whites, thus preventing
an equal mobility of facial expression.</p>

<p>The anomalies of the muscular structure seem about
as frequent in one race as in another. The most of
them are regressive, imitating the muscles of the apes,
monkeys, and lower mammals. Indeed, a learned
anatomist has said that the abnormal anatomy of the
muscles supplies all the gaps which separate man
from the higher apes, as all the simian characteristics
reappear from time to time in his structure.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Certain motions or positions, such as I may call
“muscular habits,” are characteristic of extensive
groups of tribes. The method of resting is one such.
The Japanese squats on his hams, the Australian
stands on one leg, supporting himself by a spear or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
pole, and so on. The methods of arrow-release have
been profitably studied by Professor E. S. Morse.
He finds them so characteristic that he classifies them
ethnographically, with reference to savagery and civilization,
and locality. The three most important are the
primary, the Mediterranean, and the Mongolian releases.
The first is that of many savage tribes, the
second was practiced principally by the white race, the
last by the Mongolians and their neighbors. (Figs. 6,
7, 8.) The last two are the most effective, and thus
gave superiority in combat.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Fig. 7.&mdash;Mediterranean Arrow-Release.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p></div>

<p>Allied to muscular variation are the peculiar deposits
of fatty tissue in certain portions of the system.
The Hottentots are remarkable for the prominence
of the gluteal region, imparting to their figure a
singular projection posteriorly. It is called “steatopygy,”
and appears to have been, in part at least, a
cultivated deformity, regarded among them as a
beauty. The thick lips of the negro, and the long and
pendent breasts of the Australian women, are other examples
of ethnic hypertrophies.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_008" src="images/fig_008.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.&mdash;Mongolian Arrow-Release.</p></div>

<p><i>Stature and Proportion.</i>&mdash;Differences in stature are
tribal, but not racial. The smallest peoples known,
the Negrillos, the Aetas, the Lapps, belong to different
races, as do the tallest, the Patagonians, the Polynesians,
the Anglo-Americans. The researches of Paolo
Riccardi and others prove that stature is correlated
with nutrition; the better the food, other things being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
equal, the taller the men.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> It is also markedly
hereditary; the stature of children will average that of
their parents.</p>

<p>What is called the “canon of proportions” of the
human body varies with the race and the nation.
There is indeed an ideal, an artistic canon, which the
sculptor or the painter seeks to body forth in his
productions; and this seems in close conformity with
an extensive average of the proportions of the highest
peoples; but it is never found in individuals, and it is
essentially unlike in man and woman, in youth and
age, in the blonde and brunette.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Nor is the ideal of
the artist also that which is consonant with the greatest
muscular development or highest powers of endurance.</p>

<p><i>Special Senses.</i>&mdash;It cannot be said that the different
races display positive discrepancies in the special
senses. Their development appears to depend on
cultivation, and all races respond equally to equal
training. There is, to be sure, a higher musical sense
in the native African than in the native American, but
quite as much difference is seen between European
nations.</p>

<p>Much has been written of the color-sense as a trait
of nations. It has been said that some tribes, some
races, appreciate hues more keenly than others; that
within historic times marked gains in this respect are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
noticeable. I think these statements are incorrect.
The savage of any race distinguishes precisely the difference
of hues when it is to his material interest so to
do; but concerns himself not at all about colors which
have no effect on his life. He is well acquainted with
the colors of the animals he hunts, and has a word for
every shade of hue. This proves that his color-sense
is as acute as that of civilized people, and merely lacks
specific training.</p>

<p><i>Ethnic Relations of the Sexes.</i>&mdash;There are some
curious facts in reference to the relative position of the
sexes in different peoples. As a rule the expression
of sex in form and feature is less in the lower than in
the higher races. Travelers frequently refer to the
difficulty of distinguishing the men from the women
among the American Indians or the Chinese. Investigate
the fact, and you will find that it is not that the
women are less feminine in appearance, but the men
less masculine. In other words, the expression of sex
in such peoples is less in man than in woman. This
seems to be true also of the highest ideals of manhood
in artistic conception. The Greek Apollo, the
traditional Christ, present a feminine type of the male.
This was carried to its excess in the Greek Hermaphrodite.</p>

<p>The reason for this approximation to the female in
art-ideals is probably the zoological fact that the law
of beauty in the human species is the reverse of that
in all the other higher mammals, the female sex with
us being the handsomer. This also becomes more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
evident in the comparison of the best developed
peoples.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the muscular force of the sexes
presents the greatest contrast in nations of the highest
culture. The average European woman of twenty-five
or thirty has one-third less muscular power than the
average European man. But among the Afghans, the
Patagonians, the Druses and other tribes, the women
are as tall and as strong as the men; and in Siam, Ashanti,
Ancient Gaul, and elsewhere, not only the field-laborers
but the soldiers were principally women,
selected because of their greater physical force and
courage.</p>

<p>As the value of mere brute force in a social organization
lessens in comparison to mental powers, the
condition of woman improves, and her faculties find
appropriate play. Her brain capacity, though absolutely
less, is relatively more than man’s. That is, the
difference of the whole average weight of woman and
man is greater in proportion than the difference of their
brain weights.</p>

<p>It is believed, also, that the viability or prospect of
life in woman is greater in higher than in lower peoples;
and generally greater than in men. European
statistics show that 106 boys are born to 100 girls:
but at twelve years of age the sexes are equal, the
boys suffering a greater mortality. At eighty years
of age, there are nearly three women living to one
man, indicating a superior longevity.</p>

<p><i>Correlation of Physical Traits to Vital Powers.</i>&mdash;The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
physical traits are correlated to the physiological
functions in such a manner as profoundly to influence
the destiny of nations. They enable or disable
man with reference to the climatic and other
conditions of his surroundings. For instance, certain
races can support given temperature better than
others. The intense heat and humidity of Central
Africa or Southern India are destructive to the pure
whites, while the climate north of the fortieth parallel
soon exterminates the blacks. The food on which
the Australian thrives destroys the digestive powers
of the European. Exemption and liability to diseases
differ noticeably in races. The white race is more
liable to yellow fever, malarial diseases, syphilis, scarlet
fever and sunstroke; the colored races to measles,
tuberculosis, leprosy, elephantiasis, and pneumonia.</p>

<p>Indeed, from the physical point of view, the pure
white is weaker than the dark races, worse prepared
for the combat of life, with inferior viability. This
has been shown by the careful researches of statisticians.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
But in the white this is more than compensated
by the development of the nervous system and the
intellectual power. He can bear greater mental strain
than any other race, and the activity of his mind supplies
him with means to overcome the inferiority of
his body, and thus places him at the head of the whole
species.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>The <i>tolerance of disease</i> is an obscure but momentous
element in the comparison of races. It is
almost a proverb among the Spanish-American physicians
that “when an Indian falls sick, he dies.” The
greater longevity of the European peoples is due to
their ability to support disease long and frequently,
without succumbing to it. On the other hand, surgical
injuries, wounds and cuts, appear to heal more rapidly
among savage peoples.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> It is clear that in civilized
conditions this is less important than tolerance.</p>

<p><i>The Causes of the Fixation of Ethnic Traits.</i>&mdash;These
causes are mainly related to climate and the
food-supply. The former embraces the questions of
temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure (altitude),
malarial or zymotic poisons, and the like. All
these bear directly upon the relative activity of the
great physiological organs, the lungs, heart, liver, skin
and kidneys, and to their action we must undoubtedly
turn for the origin of the traits I have named. On the
food-supply, liquid and solid, whether mainly animal,
fish or vegetable, whether abundant or scanty, whether
rich in phosphates and nitrogenous constituents or the
reverse, depend the condition of the digestive organs,
the nutrition of the individual, and the development
of numerous physical idiosyncrasies. Nutrition controls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
the direction of organic development, and it is
essentially on arrested or imperfect, in contrast to
completed development, that the differences of races
depend.</p>

<p>These are the physiological and generally unavoidable
influences which went to the fixation of racial
types. They are those which placed early man under
the dominion of natural, unconscious evolution, like
all the lower animals. To them may be added natural
selection from accidental variations becoming permanent
when proving of value in the struggle for existence,
as shown in the black hue of equatorial tribes,
special muscular development, etc.</p>

<p>But I do not look on these as the main agents in the
fixation of special traits. No doubt such agencies primarily
evolved them, but their cultivation and perpetuation
were distinctly owing to <i>conscious</i> selection in
early man. Our species is largely outside the general
laws of organic evolution, and that by virtue of the
self-consciousness which is the privilege of it alone
among organized beings.</p>

<p>This conscious selection was applied in two most
potent directions, the one to maintaining the <i>physical
ideal</i>, the other toward <i>sexual preference</i>.</p>

<p>As soon as the purely physical influences mentioned
had impressed a tendency toward a certain type on the
early community, this was recognized, cultivated and
deepened by man’s conscious endeavors. Every race,
when free from external influence, assigns to its highest
ideal of manly or womanly beauty its special racial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
traits, and seeks to develop these to the utmost. African
travelers tell us that the negroes of the Soudan
look with loathing on the white skin of the European;
and in ancient Mexico when children were born of a
very light color, as occasionally happened, they were
put to death. On the other hand the earliest records
of the white race exalt especially the element of whiteness.
The writer of the Song of Solomon celebrates
his bride as “fairest among women,” with a neck
“like a tower of ivory;”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> and one of the oldest of
Irish hero-tales, the <i>Wooing of Emer</i>, chants the
praises of “Tara, the whitest of maidens.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Though
both Greeks and Egyptians were of the dark type of
the Mediterranean peoples, their noblest gods, Apollo
and Osiris, were represented “fair in hue, and with
light or golden hair.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>The persistent admiration of an ideal leads to its
constant cultivation by careful preservation and sexual
selection. Thus the peoples who have little hair on
the face and body, as most Chinese and American Indians,
usually do not like any, and carefully extirpate
it. The negroes prefer a flat nose, and a child which
develops one of a pointed type has it artificially flattened.
In Melanesia if a child is born of a lighter hue
than is approved by the village, it is assiduously held
over the smoke of a fire in order to blacken it. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
custom of destroying infants markedly aberrant from
the national type is nigh universal in primitive life.
Such usages served to fix and perpetuate the racial
traits.</p>

<p>A yet more powerful factor was <i>sexual preference</i>.
This worked in a variety of ways. If is well known to
stock breeders that the closer animals are bred in-and-in,
that is, the nearer the relationship of father and
mother, the more prominently the traits of the parents
appear in their children and become fixed in the breed.
It is evident that in the earliest epoch of the human
family, the closest inter-breeding must have prevailed
without restriction, as it does in every species of the
lower animals. By its influences the racial traits were
rapidly strengthened and indelibly impressed. This,
however, was long before the dawn of history, for it is
a most remarkable fact that never in historic times has
a tribe been known that allowed incestuous relations,
unless as in ancient Egypt and Persia, for a sacrificial
or ceremonial purpose. The lowest Australians, the
degraded Utes, look with horror on the union of
brother and sister. The general principle of marriage
in savage races is that of “exogamy,” marriage outside
the clan or family, the latter being counted in the
female line only. This strange but universal abhorrence
has been explained by Darwin as primarily the
result of sexual indifference arising between members
of the same household, and the high zest of novelty in
that appetite. Whatever the cause, the consequences
will easily be seen. The racial traits once fixed in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
period before this abhorrence arose would remain
largely stationary afterwards, and by exogamous marriages
would be rendered uniform over a wide area.</p>

<p>This form of conscious selection has properly been
rated as one of the prime factors in the problem of
race differentiation.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> The apparently miscellaneous
and violent union of the sexes in savage tribes is in
fact governed by the most stringent traditional laws,
and their confused cohabitations are so only to the
mind of the European observer, not to the tribal conscience.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p><i>Causes of Variation in Types.</i>&mdash;The physical type
once fixed by the influences just mentioned remains
very stable; yet may fall under the influence of conditions
which will greatly modify it.</p>

<p>Changes in climatic surroundings and of the food
supply exert a visible effect. These generally come
about by migration, though geologic action has occasionally
completely altered the climate of a given locality,
as at the glacial epoch, which change would
have the same effect as migration.</p>

<p>How far migration may alter race-types after many
generations is not yet defined. The Spanish-American
of pure white blood, whose ancestors have lived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
for three centuries in tropical America, the citizen of
the United States who traces his genealogy to the
passengers in the Mayflower or the Welcome, have
departed extremely little from the standard of the Andalusian
or the Englishman of to-day, though the
contrary is often asserted by those who have not personally
studied the variants in the countries compared.
Conditions of climate and food materially impress the
individual, but not the race. The Greeks of Nubia
are as dark as Nubians, but let their children return to
Greece and the Nubian hue is lost. This is a general
truth and holds good of all the slight impressions made
upon pure races by unaccustomed environments.</p>

<p>Another cause of variation is the recurrence to
remote ancestral traits, or the appearance of what
seem merely accidental variations, which may be perpetuated.
It is not very unusual in pure African
negroes and Chinese to observe instances of reddish
hair and gray or brown eyes.</p>

<p>Those peculiar congenital conditions known as <i>albinism</i>
and <i>melanism</i> may be frequent and are unquestionably
transmissible by descent.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p><i>The Mingling of Races.</i>&mdash;But the mightiest cause
in the change of types is intermarriage between races,
what the French call <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métissage</i>. This has taken place
from distantly remote epochs, especially along the lines
where two races come into contact. In such regions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
we always find numerous mixed breeds, leading to a
shading of one race into another by imperceptible
degrees.</p>

<p>The widespread custom of exogamous marriage
fostered the blending of types, and it was greatly
increased in early days by the institution of human
slavery, the habit of selling captives taken in war, the
purchase of wives and concubines, and the rule in
early conquest that the men of the conquered were
killed or sent off, and the women retained as the spoils
of the victors. In all ages man has been migratory,
and very remote relics of his arts show that war and
commerce led to extensive intermixture of races long
before history took up the thread of his wanderings.</p>

<p>It is noticeable, however, that these prolonged interminglings
have not produced another race. The
nearest approach to it is in the Australians, but these
do not refute my statement as we shall see later.
Many ethnologists have indeed classed the mixed types
as separate races, running the number of the sub-species
of the genus <i>homo</i> up to thirty or forty. But
this was hasty generalization.</p>

<p>I would impress upon you this fact, that since the
intermingling of two races <i>does not produce a third
race</i>, it is not likely that any of the existing races arose
from a fusion of two others. The result of observation
shows that after two or three generations the tendency
in mixed breeds is to recur to one or the other
of the original stocks, not to establish a different
variety.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>Were it not for such constant crossings, we have
reason to believe that the race types would resist all
environment and retain their traits under all known
conditions. It is only where the element of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métissage</i>
prominently enters that we are unable to assign individuals
to one or another race.</p>

<p>Such being the case, it is a fair comparison to set
one race over against another and deduce the</p>

<p><i>Physical Criteria of Racial Superiority.</i>&mdash;We are accustomed
familiarly to speak of “higher” and “lower”
races, and we are justified in this even from merely
physical considerations. These indeed bear intimate
relations to mental capacity, and where the body presents
many points of arrested or retarded development,
we may be sure that the mind will also.</p>

<p>There are two explanations of the presence of the
inferior physical traits in certain races of men; the
one, that of the evolutionists, that they are reversions
or perpetuations of the ape-like (simian, pithecoid)
features of the lower animal which was man’s immediate
ancestor; the other, that of the special creationists,
that they are instances of surviving fetal peculiarities,
or else deficiency or excess of development from unknown
causes.</p>

<p>The following are the principal traits of the kind:</p>

<p>Simplicity and early union of cranial sutures.</p>

<p>Presence of the frontal process of the temporal
bone.</p>

<p>Wide nasal aperture, with synostosis of the nasal
bones.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>Prominence of the jaws.</p>

<p>Recession of the chin.</p>

<p>Early appearance, size and permanence of the “wisdom”
teeth.</p>

<p>Unusual length of the humerus.</p>

<p>Perforation of the humerus.</p>

<p>Continuation of the “heart” line across the hand.</p>

<p>Obliquity (narrowness) of the pelvis.</p>

<p>Deficiency of the calf of the leg.</p>

<p>Flattening of the tibia.</p>

<p>Elongation of the heel (os calcis).</p>

<p>When all or many of these traits are present, the
individual approaches physically the type of the anthropoid
apes, and a race presenting many of them is
properly called a “lower” race. On the other hand,
where they are not present, the race is “higher,” as it
maintains in their integrity the special traits of the
genus Man, and is true to the type of the species.</p>

<p>The adult who retains the more numerous fetal, infantile
or simian traits, is unquestionably inferior to
him whose development has progressed beyond them,
nearer to the ideal form of the species, as revealed by
a study of the symmetry of the parts of the body, and
their relation to the erect stature.</p>

<p>Measured by these criteria, the European or white
race stands at the head of the list, the African or negro
at its foot.</p>

<p>The investigations of anthropologists extend much
beyond the outlines I have now presented you. All
parts of the body have been minutely scanned, measured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
and weighed, in order to erect a science of the
comparative anatomy of the races. Much of value has
been discovered; but nothing absolutely characteristic,
nothing which enables us to divide more sharply
one race from another than the facts I have given you.
It is a question, indeed, whether not too much, but
too exclusive attention has not been devoted by many
anthropologists to the purely physical aspects of their
science. They have multiplied useless anatomical
refinements and a pedantic nomenclature. The more
valuable general distinctions and their technical terms
I present to you in the following table:&mdash;</p>

<p>The mental differences of races and nations are real
and profound. Some of them are just as valuable
for ethnic classification as any of the physical elements
I referred to in the last lecture, although purely physical
anthropologists are loath to admit this. No one
can deny, however, that it is the psychical endowment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
of a tribe or a people which decides fatally its luck in
the fight of the world. Those, therefore, who would
master the highest significance of ethnography in its
function as the key to history, will devote to this
branch of it their most earnest attention.</p>

<p>The study of the general mental peculiarities of a
people is called “ethnic psychology.” As a science, it
may be treated by various methods, applicable to the
different aims of research. For our present purpose,
which is to study the growth, migrations and comminglings
of races and peoples, the most suggestive
method will be to classify their mental distinctions
under the two main headings of Associative and Dispersive
Elements. The predominance of one or the
other of these is ever eminently formative in the character
and history of a people, and both must be constantly
considered with reference to their bearings on
the progress of a nation toward civilization.</p>

<p>The psychical development of men and nations finds
its chief explanation, less in the natural surroundings,
the climate, soil, and water-currents, as is taught by
some philosophers, than in their relations and connections
with each other, their friendships, federations
and enmities, their intercourse in commerce, love and
war. Around these must center the chief studies of
ethnographic science, for they contain and present the
means for reaching its highest, almost its only aim&mdash;the
comprehension of the social and intellectual progress
of the species.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Associative Elements.</span></h3>

<p>The sense of fellowship, the gregarious instinct, was
inherited by our first fathers from their anthropoid
ancestors. The “river drift” men, who dwelt on the
banks of the Thames and the Somme before the glacial
epoch, were gathered into small communities, as
their remains testify. The most savage tribes, Fuegians
and Australians, roam about in detached bands.
They are not under the control of a chief, but are led
to such union by much the same motives as prompt
buffaloes to gather in a herd.</p>

<p>These fundamental mental elements which impel to
association are:</p>

<h4><i>1. The Social Instincts.</i></h4>

<p>Strongest of them all is <i>the sexual impulse</i>. The
foundation of every community is the bond of the
man and woman, and the nature of this bond is the
surest test of a community’s position in the scale of
culture. It is not likely that miscellaneous cohabitation,
or that slightly modified form of it called “communal
marriage,” ever existed. No instance of it has
been known to history.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> In the most brutal tribes the
man asserts his right of ownership in the woman.
The rare custom of “polyandry,” where a woman has
several husbands at once, gives her no general license.</p>

<p>It is equally true that the tender sentiments of love
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
appear to be less known to the lowest savages than
they are to beasts and birds. The process of mating
is by brute force, marriage is by robbery, and the
women are in a wretched slavery. Mutual affection
has no existence. Such is the state of affairs among
the Australians, the western Eskimos, the Athapascas,
the Mosquitos, and many other tribes.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>But it is gratifying to find that we have to mount
but a step higher in the scale to find the germs of a
nobler understanding of the sex relation. In many
tribes of but moderate culture, their languages supply
us with evidence that the sentiment of love was awake
among them, and this is corroborated by the incidents
we learn of their domestic life. This I have shown
in considerable detail by an analysis of the words for
love and affection in the languages of the Algonkins,
Nahuas, Mayas, Qquichuas, Tupis and Guaranis, all
prominent tribes of the American Indians.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>Some of the songs and stories of this race seem to
reveal even a capability for romantic love, such as
would do credit to a modern novel. This is the more
astonishing, as in the African and Mongolian races
this ethereal sentiment is practically absent, the idealism
of passion being something foreign to those varieties
of man.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>The sequel of the sexual impulse is the formation
of the family through the development of <i>parental
affection</i>. This instinct is as strong in many of the
lower animals as in human beings. In primitive conditions
it is largely confined to the female parent, the
father paying but slight attention to the welfare of
his offspring. To this, rather than to a doubt of paternity,
should we attribute the very common habit in
such communities, of reckoning ancestry in the female
line only.</p>

<p>Akin to this is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">filial</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fraternal</i> affection, leading
to a preservation of the family bond through generations,
and in spite of local separation. It is surprising
how strong is this sentiment even in conditions of low
culture. The Polynesians preserved their genealogies
through twenty generations; the Haidah Indians of
Vancouver’s Island boast of fifteen or eighteen.</p>

<p>The sentiment of <i>friendship</i> has been supposed by
some to be an acquisition of higher culture. Nothing
is more erroneous. Dr. Carl Lumholtz tells me he has
seen touching examples of it among Australian cannibals,
and the records of travelers are full of instances
of devoted affection in members of savage tribes, both
toward each other and toward persons of other races.
There are established rites in early social conditions,
by which a stranger is received into the bond of fellowship
and the sanctity of friendship.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> This is often
by a transfer of the blood of the one to the body of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
other, or a symbolic ceremony to that effect, the meaning
being that the stranger is thus admitted to the
rights of kinship in the gens or clan. Springing from
this clannish affection is the custom of <i>ancestral worship</i>,
which adds a link to the bond of the family. It
is so widely spread that Herbert Spencer has endeavored
to derive from it all other forms of religion.
But this is a hasty generalization. The religious sentiment
had many other primitive forms of expression.</p>

<p>Through these various personal affections we reach
the development of the family into the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gens</i>, the clan
or <i>totem</i>, all of whose members, whether by consanguinity
or adoption, are held to represent one interest.</p>

<p>The union of several gentes under one control constitutes
the <i>tribe</i>, which is the first step toward what is
properly a <i>state</i>. The tribe passes beyond the ties of
affinity by embracing in certain common interests persons
who are not recognized as allied in blood. Yet
it is curious to note that the tribal sentiments are
among the very strongest mankind ever exhibits, surpassing
those of family affection. Brutus felt no hesitation
in sacrificing his son for the common weal.
Classical antiquity is full of admonitions and examples
to the same effect. So powerful is the devotion of the
Polynesians that they have been known when a canoe
was capsized where sharks abounded, to form a ring
around their chief, and sacrifice themselves one by one
to the ravenous fish, that he might escape.</p>

<p>This sentiment of <i>personal loyalty</i> has been in history
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
the main strength of many a government, and has
in it something chivalric and noble, which challenges
our admiration; yet it is quite opposed to the principles
of republicanism and the equal rights of individuals,
and we must condemn it as belonging to a lower
stage of evolution than that to which we have arrived.</p>

<p>The result of these gregarious instincts is the formation
of the <i>social organization</i>, the bond under which
first the primitive horde and later the members of the
developed commonwealth consented to live. From
first to last, wherever found, communities of men are
bound together by ties of consanguinity and affection
rather than mere self-interest. Those writers who
pretend that society once existed without the idea of
kinship, with promiscuity in the sexual relation, and
without some recognized controlling power, have
failed to produce such an example from actual life.</p>

<p>These ties led to the systems of “consanguinity and
affinity” which recur with singular sameness at a certain
stage of culture the world over. They give rise to
what is called the totemic or gentile phase of society,
in which its members are organized into “gentes” or
clans, “phratries” or associations of clans, and the
tribe, which embraces several such phratries. This
theory affected the disposition of property, which belonged
to the clan and not to the individual, and the
form of government, which was usually by a council
appointed from the various clans. The recognition of
the wide prevalence of these ideas in the ancient world
has led to profound modifications of our views respecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
its institutions, and a better understanding of
many of the events of history.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>In social organizations one of the criteria of excellence
is the <i>position of woman</i>. Upon this depends the
life of the family and the development of morality.
Those nations which have gained the most enduring
conquests in power and culture have conceded to woman
a prominent place in social life. In ancient Egypt,
in Etruria, in republican Rome, women owned property,
and enjoyed equal rights under the law. Where
woman is enslaved, as among the Australian tribes,
progress is scarcely possible; where she is imprisoned,
as in Mohammedan countries, progress may be rapid
for a time, but is not permanent. Unusual mental
ability in a man is generally inherited from his mother,
and a nation which studies to prevent women from acquiring
an education and from taking an active part in
affairs, is preparing the way to engender citizens of
inferior minds.</p>

<p>Among other ethnic traits, the appreciation of the
<i>ethical</i> standard differs notably. Long ago the observant
Montaigne commented on the conflicting
views of morals in nations, and remarked rather cynically
that what was good on one side of a river was
deemed wicked on the other. This is especially noticeable
in the sense of justice, the rights of property,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
and the regard for truth. No Asiatic nation respects
truth telling, or can be made to see that it is abstractly
desirable when it conflicts with their immediate interests.
The rights of property are generally construed
entirely differently to ourselves among nations
in the lower grades of culture, because the idea of independent
personal ownership does not exist among
them. What they have belongs to the clan or the
horde, and they merely have the use of it.</p>

<p>The basis of ethics in all undeveloped conditions is
not general but special; it relates to the tribe and the
family, and is in direct conflict with the philosopher
Kant’s famous “categorical imperative,” which makes
the basis the welfare of the whole species. Hence, in
primitive culture and survivals there is a dual system
of morals, the one of kindness, love, help and peace,
applicable to the members of our own clan, tribe or
community; the other of robbery, hatred, enmity and
murder, to be practiced against all the rest of the
world; and the latter is regarded as quite as much a
sacred duty as the former.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Ethics, therefore, while
a powerfully associative element in the one direction,
becomes dispersive or segregating in others, unless
the sense of duty is taught as a universal and not as a
class or national conception.</p>

<p>The sentiment of <i>modesty</i> is developed by man in
society, and he alone among animals possesses it.
Whatever has been said to the contrary, it is never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
absent. Frequently, indeed, its manifestation is not
according to our usages, and is thus overlooked.
Women with us expose their faces, which a Moorish
lady would think most indelicate. The Bedawin women
consider it immodest to have the back of the head
uncovered; the Siamese think nothing of displaying
nude limbs, but on no account would show the uncovered
sole of the foot. In certain African courts, the
men wear long robes while the women appear nude.
The necessary functions of the body are everywhere
veiled by retirement, and in the most savage tribes, a
regard for decency is constantly noted.</p>

<p>The second chief associative principle is</p>

<h4><i>2. Language.</i></h4>

<p>Unlike the elements of affection which I have been
tracing, language is not a legacy from a brute ancestor.
It is the peculiar property of the genus Man, and no
tribe has ever been known without a developed grammatical
articulate speech, with abundance of expressions
for all its ideas. The stories of savages so rude
that they were forced to eke out their words with
gestures, and could not make themselves intelligible
in the dark, are fables. The languages of the most
barbarous communities are always ample in forms,
and often surprisingly flexible, rich and sonorous.</p>

<p>We must indeed suppose a time when the speech of
primeval man had a feeble, imperfect beginning.
“The origin of language” has been a favorite theme
for philologists to speculate about, with sparse fruit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
for their readers. We can, indeed, picture to ourselves
something like what it must have been in its
very early stages, by studying a number of very simple
languages, and noting what parts of the grammar and
dictionary they dispense with. Following this plan, I
once undertook to show what might have been the
language of man far back in palæolithic times. It
probably had no “parts of speech,” such as nouns,
pronouns, prepositions or adjectives; it had no gender,
number nor case, no numerals and no conjugations.
The different sounds, vowels or consonants, conveyed
specific significations, and each phrase was summed
up in a single word.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>In some such way language began. But remember
that this is quite another question from the origin of
<i>languages</i>, or, to use the proper term, of <i>linguistic
stocks</i>. They are very numerous, and many of comparatively
late birth. Those convolutions of the brain
which preside over speech once developed, man did
not have to repeat his long and toilsome task of acquiring
linguistic facility. Children are always originating
new words and expressions, and if two or three
infants are left much together, they will soon have a
tongue of their own, unlike anything they hear around
them. Numerous examples of this character have
been collected by Horatio Hale, and upon them he
has based an entirely satisfactory theory of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
source of that multiplicity of languages which we find
in various parts of the globe.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> In the unstable life of
barbarous epochs, very young children were often left
without parents or protectors, or wandered off and
were lost. Most of them doubtless perished, but those
who survived developed a tongue of their own, nearly
all whose radicals would be totally different from those
of the language of their parents. Thus in early times
numerous dialects, numerous independent tongues,
came to be spoken within limited areas by the same
ethnic stock.</p>

<p>It is a common error to suppose that there was
once but one or a few languages, from which all others
have been derived. The reverse is the case. Within
the historic period, the number of languages has been
steadily diminishing. We know of scores which have
become extinct, as many American tongues; others,
like the Celtic, are in plain process of disappearance.
We can almost predict the time when the work and
the thought of the world will be carried on in less
than half a dozen tongues, if indeed that many survive
as really active.</p>

<p>If we take a comprehensive survey of the grammatical
structure of all known tongues, we are cheered by
the discovery that they can be divided into a few great
classes or groups. The similarities of each group
are not in words or sounds, but in the plan of “expressing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
the proposition,” or placing words together
in a phrase to convey an idea.</p>

<p>This may be accomplished in one of four ways:</p>

<p>1. By <i>isolation</i>. The words representing the parts
of the phrase may be ranged one after another without
any change. This is the case in the Chinese and
the languages of Farther India.</p>

<p>2. By <i>agglutination</i>. The principal word in the
phrase may have added to it or placed before it a number
of syllables expressing the relations to it of the
other ideas. Most African and North Asian tongues
are agglutinative.</p>

<p>3. By <i>incorporation</i>. The accessory words are
either inserted within the verbal members of the sentence,
or attached to it in abbreviated forms, so that
the phrase has the appearance of one word. Most
American languages belong to this type.</p>

<p>4. By <i>inflection</i>. Each word of the sentence indicates
by its own form its relation to the main proposition.
All Aryan and Semitic idioms are more or less
inflected.</p>

<p>These distinctions have great ethnographic interest.
They almost deserve to be called racial traits. Thus,
the inflected languages belonged originally solely to
the European race; the isolating languages are still
confined wholly to the Sinitic branch of the Asian
race; the incorporative languages are found nowhere
of such pure type and so numerous as in the American
race; while the agglutinative type is that alone which
is found in independent examples in every race.

<p>The principles on which languages should be compared
are frequently misunderstood, and this is one of
the reasons why the value of linguistics to ethnography
has so often been underrated.</p>

<p>The first rule which should be observed is to <i>rank
grammatical structure far above verbal coincidences</i>.
The neglect of this rule will condemn any effort at
comparison. For example, there have been writers
who have sought to derive the Polynesian, an agglutinative,
from the Sanscrit, an inflected tongue; or an
American from a Semitic stock. Such attempts reveal
an ignorance of the nature of language.</p>

<p>A second rule is that in tracing the etymology of
words, the <i>phonetic laws of the special group to which
they belong</i> must be followed. This is an even more
frequent source of error than the former. Writers of
high reputation will trace variations in African or
American or Semitic names by the phonetic laws of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
the Aryac dialects&mdash;an absurd error, as the phonetic
changes are not at all the same in different linguistic
stocks.</p>

<p>Yet a third rule is <i>to appraise correctly the value of
verbal identities</i>. Generally, it is placed too high. All
developed tongues include many “loan words,” borrowed
from a variety of sources. They are not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima
facie</i> evidence of ethnic relation; they have frequently
been transmitted through other nations, as is the case
with thousands of English words.</p>

<p>An absolute verbal identity is always suspicious;
or rather it is of <i>no</i> ethnic value. There must be a
series of words in the languages compared of the same
or similar meanings, but whose forms have been altered
by the phonetic laws peculiar to the group, for
such lists of words to merit the attention of a scientific
linguist.</p>

<p>The question how far languages can be accepted as
indicating the relationships of peoples has been a bone
of contention. One principle we may lay down, with
unimportant exceptions&mdash;<i>No nation has ever willingly
adopted a foreign tongue.</i> Whenever such a change
has taken place, it has been under stress of sovereignty,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi coactum</i>, as the lawyers say. Hence in the
savage state, where prolonged domination of one tribe
by another rarely occurs, language is an excellent
ethnic guide, as in America and ancient Europe.</p>

<p>Another principle is that in a conflict of tongues, as
after conquest, <i>that tongue prevails which belongs to
the more cultured people</i>, whether this be conqueror or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
conquered. This is well illustrated by the survival of
the Romance languages after the inroads of the Teutonic
hordes at the Fall of the Western Empire.</p>

<p>A third maxim in linguistic ethnography is that
<i>mixture of languages, especially in grammatical structure,
indicates mixture of blood</i>. When, for instance,
we find the Maltese a dialect partly Arabic, partly
Romance, we may correctly infer that the people of
the island are descended from both these stocks.
This holds good even of loan words, when they are
numerous; for though such have no influence on the
grammatical structure of a tongue, they testify to
some relations between nations, which we may be sure
corresponded to others of a sexual nature.</p>

<p>The “American citizens of African descent” speak
English only; and though they have been in contact
with the white race for but three or four generations,
the majority of those now living are related to it by
blood, that is, are mulattoes.</p>

<p>The <i>mental aptitude</i> of a nation is closely dependent
on the type of its idiom. The mind is profoundly influenced
by its current modes of vocal expression.
When the form of the phrase is such that each idea is
kept clear and apart, as it is in nature, and yet its relations
to other ideas in the phrase and the sentence
are properly indicated by the grammatical construction,
the intellect is stimulated by wider variety in images
and a nicer precision in their outlines and relations.
This is the case in the highest degree with the languages
of inflection, and it is no mere coincidence that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
those peoples who have ever borne the banner in the
van of civilization have always spoken inflected
tongues. The world will be better off when all others
are extinguished, and it is only in deep ignorance of
linguistic ethnography that such a language as
<i>Volapük</i>&mdash;agglutinative in type&mdash;could have been offered
for adoption as a world-language.</p>

<p>I have said that alone of all animals, man has articulate
speech; I now add that also alone of all animals,
he is capable of</p>

<h4><i>3. Religion.</i></h4>

<p>Not only is he capable of it; he has never been
known to be devoid of it. All statements that tribes
have been discovered without any kind of religion are
erroneous. Not one of them has borne the test of close
investigation.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> The usual mistake has been to suppose
that this or that belief, this or that moral observance,
constitutes religion. In fact, there are plenty
of immoral religions, and some which are atheistic.
The notion of a God or gods is not essential to religion;
for that matter, some of the most advanced religious
teachers assert that such a notion is incompatible with
the highest religion. Religion is simply the recognition
of the Unknown as a controlling element in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
destiny of man and the world about him. This we
shall find in the cult of every nation, and in the heart
of every man.</p>

<p>Some nations identified this unknown controlling
power with one real or supposed existence, some with
another. Those in whom the family sentiment was
well developed believed themselves still under the
control of their deceased parents, giving rise to “ancestral
worship;” more frequently the change from
light to darkness, day to night, impressed the children
of nature, and led to light and sun worship; in some
localities the terrific force displayed in the cyclone or
the thunder-storm seemed the mightiest revelation of
the Unknown, and we have the Lightning and Storm
Myths; elsewhere, any odd or strange object, any unexplained
motion, was attributed to the divine, the
<i>super</i>-natural. The last mentioned mental state gave
rise to those low cults called “fetichism” and “animism,”
while the former are supposed to be somewhat
higher and are distinguished as “polytheisms.” In all
of them, the prevailing sentiment is fear of the Unknown;
the spirit of worship is propitiatory, the gods
being regarded as jealous and inclined to malevolence;
the cult is of the nature of sorcery, certain formulas,
rites and sacrifices being held to placate or neutralize
the ill-will or bad temper of the divinities. In its
lowest forms this is called “shamanism;” in its highest,
it is seen in all dogmatic religions.</p>

<p>In early conditions, each tribe has its own gods,
which are not supposed to be superior, except in force,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
to the gods of neighboring tribes. No attempt is made
to extend their worship beyond the tribe, and in their
images they are liable to be captured, as are their votaries.
Special prisons for such captive gods were
constructed in ancient Rome and Cuzco.</p>

<p>These “tribal religions” prevailed everywhere in
early historic times. The religion of the ancient Israelites,
such as we find it portrayed in the Pentateuch,
was of this character. In later days, profoundly religious
minds of philosophic cast perceived that tribal
cults do not satisfy the loftiest aspirations of the religious
sentiment. The conceptions of the highest truths
must be universal conceptions, and in obedience to
this the Universal or World-religions were formed.</p>

<p>The earliest of these was preached by Sakya Muni,
Prince of Kapilavastu, in India, about 500 B. C. It is
known as Buddhism, and has now the largest number
of believers of any one faith. The second was that
taught by Christ, and the third is Islam, introduced by
Mohammed in the seventh century. It is noteworthy
that all these world-religions were framed by members
of the white race. None has been devised by members
of the other races, for the doctrines advanced by
Confutse and Laotse in China are philosophic systems
rather than religions.</p>

<p>The three World-religions named have rapidly extinguished
the various tribal religions, and it is easy
to foresee that in a few generations they will virtually
embrace the religious sentiments of all mankind.
They are all three on the increase, Christianity the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
most rapidly by the extension of the nations adhering
to it, but Mohammedanism can claim in the present
century the greater number of proselytes, its fields
being in Central Asia, India, and Central Africa.</p>

<p>In the ethnographic study of religions for the purpose
of estimating their influence on the life and
character of nations, we must take notice especially
of three points: 1. The ethical contents of a faith;
2. The philosophic “theory of things” on which it is
based (cosmogony, theosophy, etc.), and 3. Its power
over the emotions, as upon this rests its practical
potency.</p>

<p>As currently taught, no one of the three world-religions
named is fully adequate on all these points.
The cosmogony of Christianity is a series of Assyrian
and Hebrew myths contradicted by modern science,
and its ethical purity has been often sullied by efforts
to place faith in dogmas above the law of conscience.
Mohammedanism, a more genuine monotheism than
Christianity, in some respects higher in practical morality
(temperance, charity, equality), and certainly
superior in power over the emotions, is weak in its
doctrine of fatalism and in its degradation of woman.
Buddhism is tainted by a profound distrust of the
value of the individual life, by a false theory of the
universe, and by its borrowed doctrine of metempsychosis;
but rises high in its appeals to the sense of
justice and right within the mind.</p>

<p>A religion tends to elevate its votaries in the proportion
that it withdraws their minds from merely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
material aims, and sets before them stimulating ideals.
This is the distinction between “material” and
“ideal” cults. Where the rites are directed mainly to
conjuration, where the prayers are for good luck in
life, where the myths are mere stories of exaggerated
human shapes, there the faith is material. Such were
all the religions of the African blacks and of the Eastern
and Northern Asiatic tribes. They have never
developed any thing higher. Among the whites, however,
and in a less degree among the American Indians,
there were mythical ideal figures, ranked among the
gods, who embodied grand ideal conceptions of the
possible perfectibility of man, and served as examples
and models for the religious sentiment.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>The associative influence of a religion, whether
tribal or universal in theory, is singularly powerful.
The Mohammedan who looks toward Mecca, the
Christian who turns toward Rome, feels a like bond
of sympathy with his fellow worshippers of every race
and color, as did the Israelite who wended his way to
Jerusalem, or the Nahuatl who travelled to the sacred
city of Cholula. The pilgrimages, the Crusades, the
ecclesiastical Councils of past ages, have collected
nations together under the control of ideas stronger
than any which practical life can offer.</p>

<p>Other bonds of union are those derived from the
practice of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<h4><i>4. The Arts of Life.</i></h4>

<p>Unquestionably the earliest of these to exert such an
influence was the construction of a shelter, in other
words <i>architecture</i>. We know that even glacial man
had learned enough to make himself a house, though
it was probably inferior to that of the muskrat. In
early conditions one structure sheltered several families.
Such are called “communal houses,” and some
ethnologists have argued that they are well nigh universal
down to a very late day in the evolution of domestic
architecture. The temple, the fortified refuge,
the city with its grouped homes shut in by a common
wall of defence&mdash;all these illustrate how architecture
has ever tended to bring men together, and strengthen
their instincts of association.</p>

<p>Later in time but wider in its influence in the same
direction was the growth of <i>agriculture</i>. This art
completely revolutionized the habits of life, and rendered
possible the advent of civilization. The tribe,
dependent on hunting and fishing or on natural products
for a livelihood, is necessarily migratory and
separative in its habits. The tillage of the ground
with equal necessity demands a stable residence and a
centralization of individuals. The areas of primitive
culture, the sites of the earliest cities, were always in
situations favorable to agricultural pursuits.</p>

<p>Along with the cultivation of food-plants went
hand-in-hand the domestication of animals. The horse
was trained independently in both Europe and Asia,
some species of the dog in all continents, the ox for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
draft and the cow for milk principally in Asia, and
the camel for the deserts of Arabia and Africa. These
humble aids brought together distant tribes, and assimilated
their characters.</p>

<p>The prosecution of the various special arts, as pottery,
metal work, textile-fabrics, etc., led to the formation
of guilds and the association of workers in particular
localities favorable to obtaining and utilizing
the raw products. Each such conquest of the inventive
faculties drew men into closer bonds of harmonious
labor, and opened for them new avenues of joint industry.
The pre-historic past of the race is measured
by archæologists by the rise and extension of new
arts, not because of themselves, but because they are
indicative of improved social conditions, greater aggregations
of men, more potent actions in history.
The fine arts, in crowning the useful arts with the
iridescent glory of the ideal, impart to the handiwork
of men that universality of motive which unites all
into one brotherhood.</p>

<p>The second class of psychic traits are:</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Dispersive Elements.</span></h3>

<p>These have been of the utmost moment in the history
of the species, and a controlling factor in the
records of every people. They are derived from two
quite different impulses in human nature; the one, a
natural propensity to roam, the other, a predisposition
to contest.</p>

<p>Both have been favored by the ability of the species
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
to adapt itself to its surroundings, far surpassing that
of any other animal. There is no zone and no altitude
offering the necessary food supplies that man does not
inhabit. The cat, with its traditional “nine lives,”
perishes in the upper Andes, where men live in populous
cities. No one breed of dogs can follow man to
all latitudes. His powers of locomotion are equally
surprising. He can walk the swift horse to death, and
his steady and tireless gait will in the long-run leave
every competitor behind. An Indian will track a deer
for days and capture it through its utter fatigue. A
Tebu thinks little of passing three days under the sun
of the Sahara without drinking. Such powers as these
endow man with the highest migratory faculties of any
animal, and give rise to or have been developed from</p>

<h4><i>1. The Migratory Instincts.</i></h4>

<p>Many species of animals, especially birds, change
their habitat with the seasons, the object usually being
to obtain a better food supply. So do most hunting
and fishing tribes, and for the same reason. Often
these periodical journeys extend hundred of miles and
embrace the whole tribe.</p>

<p>This must also have been the case with primeval
man when he occupied the world in “palæolithic”
time. His home was along the shores of seas and the
banks of streams. Up and down these natural highways
he pursued his wanderings, until he had extended
his roamings over most of the habitable land.</p>

<p>What prompted him and all savage tribes is not always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
the search for food. The desire for a more
genial climate, the pressure of foes, and often mere
causeless restlessness, act as motive forces in the movements
of an unstable population. Certain peoples, as
the Gypsies, seem endowed with an hereditary instinct
for vagabondage. The nomadic hordes of the Asiatic
steppes and the wastes of the Sahara transmit a restlessness
to their descendants which in itself is an obstacle
to a sedentary life.</p>

<p>Such vagrant tribes became the colporteurs and
commercial travellers of early society. They invented
means or transportation, and conveyed the products of
one region to another. Only of late have we learned
to appreciate the wide extent of pre-historic commerce.
Long before Abraham settled in Ur of the Chaldees
(say 2000 B. C.), a well-travelled commercial road
stretched from the cities of Mesopotamia, through
Egypt to the Pillars of Hercules, and thence into Europe.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
When Hendrick Hudson sailed into the bay
of New York, the commercial relations of the tribes
who lived on its shores had already extended to the
coast of the Pacific.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>These lines of early traffic were also the lines of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
migrations of nations. They were fixed by the physical
geography of regions, and have rightly attracted
the careful attention of ethnographers. Along them,
nation has blended into nation, race fused with race.
The conviction that early man was not sedentary, but
mobile, by nature a migratory species, wandering
widely over the face of the earth, is one which has been
brought home to the ethnologist by the science of prehistoric
archæology, and it is full of significance.</p>

<h4><i>2. The Combative Instinct.</i></h4>

<p>The philosopher Hobbes taught that the natural
condition of man in society is one of perpetual warfare
with his neighbors. This grim theory is sadly attested
by a study of savage life. The wretched Fuegians,
the miserable Australians, with really nothing worth
living for, let alone dying for, fall to cutting each
other’s throats the moment that tribe encounters tribe.
So it has been in all ages, so it has been in all stages of
culture. The warrior, the hero, is the one who wins
the hearts of women by his fame, and the devotion of
men by his prowess. Civilization helps not at all. In
no century of the world’s history have such destructive
battles been fought as in the nineteenth; at no
former period have the powers of the earth collected
such gigantic armies and navies as to-day.</p>

<p>This love of combat at once separates and unites
nations. To destroy the common foe, the bonds of
national or tribal unity are drawn the tighter; and the
aversion to the enemy tends to the preservation of the
ethnic type.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>In spite of the countless miseries which follow in its
train, war has probably been the highest stimulus to
racial progress. It is the most potent excitant known
of all the faculties. The intense instinct of self-preservation
will prompt to an intellectual energy which
nothing else can awake. The grandest works of imagination,
the immortal outbursts of the poets, from
Homer to Whitman, have been under the stimulus of
the war-cry ringing in their ears.</p>

<p>The world-conquerors and the holy wars, Alexander
and Napoleon, the Crusades and the Mohammedan invasions,
have been landmarks in history, a destruction
of the effete, an introduction of the new and the viable.
Guizot’s bold statement that in the decisive battles of
the world it has been, not the strongest battalions, but
the truest idea which has conquered, may be a profound
ethnologic truth. Certain it is that in weighing
the psychical elements of man’s nature and their influence
on the past history of the species, we must assign
to his combative instincts a most prominent place as
stimulants, and we must recognize, amid all the miseries
which they have brought upon him, the part they
have played in his development. That they have always
resulted in promoting the “survival of the
fittest,” it is hard to believe, and there is much to make
us doubt; but that a great deal of the unfit has thus
been destroyed, we may reasonably accept.</p>

<p>What has been true always, is true to-day. It is
force, might, which forever exercises “the right of eminent
domain;” and this principle is as necessary as it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
is indestructible. Proudhon was logical, when, in his
treatise on <cite>War and Peace</cite>, he placed war and the
duty of waging war at the basis of all society, and defended
it as the necessary condition of civilization, inasmuch
as it alone is the highest form of judicial action,
the last appeal of the oppressed. Never, we may
be sure, will the human species be ready or willing to
forego this, the greatest of all their privileges.

<p>In the rapid survey contained in the previous lectures
you have seen in how many points the races
differ. No wonder that the question has often been
seriously mooted by scientific men, Could they all have
been derived from one common ancestral stock? This
is the old debate about “the unity of the human race,”
still surviving under the more learned terms of <i>monogenism</i>
or <i>polygenism</i>.</p>

<p>As to that other question, whether man came into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
being as such by a gradual development, evolution, or
transformation, from some lower mammal, this may be
regarded as the only hypothesis now known to science,
and must, therefore, be accepted, at least provisionally,
until some better is proposed. It is the only theory
consistent with man’s place in the zoölogical world,
and is borne out by numerous anatomical analogies,
which have been referred to in my first lecture.</p>

<p>In fact, we are driven to it by necessity. No other
origin of species than by transformation of earlier
forms has been suggested, even by those who reject it.
I do not speak of specific creation, for that supposition
does not belong to science, but to an obscurant
mysticism, which is the negative of all true knowledge.</p>

<p>But within the limits of the transformation theory
there is more than one method by which varying
forms are produced, and one of these may prove applicable
to man, in whose earliest remains we have so far
found no positive indications of a lower physical character
than he now has.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> So far, the “missing link”
is as much out of sight as ever it was; so far, man appears
to have been always what he is to-day.</p>

<p>May he not, as a species, have come into being
through a short series of well-marked varieties, each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
produced by what is called “heterogenesis,” that is,
the birth of children unlike their parents? All children
are unlike their parents, more or less; and though
at present this unlikeness is strictly within the limits
of the several races, it is the opinion of some who have
studied the matter, that in earlier geologic epochs
changes in organic forms were more rapid and more
profound than at present.</p>

<p>I am aware that this suggestion of heterogenesis
looks like a return to the ancient doctrine called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">generatio
equivoca</i>, which, in its old form, is certainly obsolete.
But there is no question that in many existing
plants and animals we find singular evidence that from
a given form another may arise, widely different in
structure, and perpetuate itself indefinitely. I am convinced
that the importance of these facts has never
been properly appreciated by students of the origin of
species, and of the origin of men in particular.</p>

<p>This, or any hypothesis of evolution, renders the
supposition quite needless that the various races had
distinct ancestral origins. Any evolutionist who accepts
the view that man is but a differentiation from
some anthropoid ape, is straining at a gnat after swallowing
the camel, if he hesitates to believe that the
comparatively slight differences between the races may
not have originated from like influences. Furthermore,
the resemblances between the various races are
altogether too numerous and exact to render it likely
that they could have been acquired through several ancestries
running back to various lower zoological
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
forms; a consideration greatly strengthened by the
fact that man is the only species of his genus, and
there is even no genus of his class closely related to
himself. The chances that such a perfected animal
should have been twice or oftener developed from the
apes, monkeys or lemurs&mdash;his nearest cousins&mdash;are so
small that we must dismiss the supposition.</p>

<p>It seems to me, indeed, that any one who will
patiently study the parallelisms of growth in the arts
and sciences, in poetry and objects of utility, throughout
the various races of men, cannot doubt of their
psychical identity. Still more, if he will acquaint himself
with the modern science of Folk-lore, and will
note how the very same tales, customs, proverbs, superstitions,
games, habits, and so on, recur spontaneously
in tribes severed by thousands of leagues, he
will not think it possible that creatures so wholly
identical could have been produced by independent
lines of evolution.</p>

<p><i>The Birthplace of the Species.</i>&mdash;Accepting the
theories therefore of the evolutionists and the monogenists
as the most plausible in the present state of
science, it is quite proper to inquire where primeval
man first appeared, and what were his social conditions
and personal appearance.</p>

<p>To some it may seem premature to put such questions.
They are needlessly timid. It is never too
soon to propound any question in science; always too
soon to declare that any has been finally and irrevocably
answered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>Beginning our search for the birthplace of the species,
we may consider that it will be indicated by the
cumulative evidence of three conditions. We may
look for it, (1) where the oldest relics of man or his
industries have been found; (2) where the remains of
the highest of the lower mammals, especially the man-like
apes, have been exhumed, as it is assumed that
man himself descended from some such form; and (3)
where we know from palæontologic evidence a climate
prevailed suited to man’s unprotected early conditions.</p>

<p>The first of these lines of investigation leads us to
the science of “pre-historic archæology.” We shall
discover that a study of this branch of learning is indispensable
not only in this connection, but to solve
many other questions in ethnography. Here its answer
is unexpected. We have been taught by long
tradition and venerable documents to look for the first
home of primeval man “somewhere in Asia,” as Professor
Max Müller generously puts it. He is inclined
to think that from the highlands of that continent the
tribes dispersed in various directions, some going to
the extreme north, and then southward into Europe.
Others would have it that the species itself came into
life in the boreal regions, in that epoch when a mild
climate prevailed there.</p>

<p>Such dreams meet no countenance from pre-historic
archæology. The oldest remains of man’s arts, the
first rude flints which he shaped into utensils and
weapons, have not been discovered in Asia, and do not
occur at all in the northern latitudes of either continent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
They have been exhumed from the late tertiary or
early quaternary deposits of southern England, of
France, of the Iberian peninsula, and of the valleys of
the Atlas in northern Africa. They have been searched
for most diligently but in vain in Scandinavia, Germany,
Russia, Siberia, and Canada. Not any of the
older types of so-called “palæolithic” implements have
been reported in early deposits in those countries.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>
But in the “river drift” of the Thames, the Somme,
the Garonne, and the Tagus, quantities of rough stone
implements have been disinterred, proving that in a
remote epoch, at a time when the hippopotamus and
rhinoceros, the African elephant and the extinct apes,
found a congenial home near the present sites of London,
Paris and Lisbon, man also was there. These
relics, especially those found in Portugal, Central Spain
and Southern France, are the very oldest proofs of the
presence of man on the earth yet brought to light.</p>

<p>Where, now, do we find the remains of the highest
of the lower animals? By a remarkable coincidence,
in the same region. Of all the anthropoid apes yet
known to the palæontologist, that most closely simulating
man is the so-called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dryopithecus fontani</i>,
whose bones have been disinterred in the upper valleys
of the Garonne, in Southern France. Its height was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
about that of a man, its teeth strongly resembled those
of the Australians, and its food was chiefly vegetables
and fruits. Other remains of a similar character have
been found in Italy.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>It is well known to geologists that the apes and
monkeys or Simiadæ were abundant and highly developed
in Southern Europe in the pliocene and early
pleistocene, just the time, as near as we can fix it, that
man first appeared there. These facts answer the third
of our inquiries&mdash;that for a climate suitable to man in
an unprotected early condition, when he had to contend
with the elements and the parsimony of nature,
ill-provided as he is with many of the natural advantages
possessed by other animals. At that date Southern
Europe and Northern Africa were under what are
called sub-tropical conditions, possessing a climate not
wholly tropical, but yet singularly mild and equable.
This we know from the remains, both animal and vegetable,
preserved in the deposits of that epoch.</p>

<p>A series of negative arguments strengthens this
conclusion. Where we find no remains of apes or
monkeys of the higher class, we cannot place the
scene of man’s ancestral evolution. This excludes
America, where no tailless and no narrow-nosed (catarhine)
monkeys and no large apes have been found;
it excludes Australia, and all portions of the Old
World north of the Alps and the Himalayas.</p>

<p>In view of such facts, Darwin reached the conclusion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
that it is most probable that our earliest progenitors
lived on the African continent. There to this
day we find on the one hand the human beings most
closely allied to the lower animals, and the two species
of these, the gorilla and the chimpanzee, now man’s

<p>Darwin was disturbed in this conclusion by the
presence of the large apes to whom I have referred in
Southern Europe in late tertiary times. This, however,
merely requires a modification in his conclusion,
the general tenor of which, to the effect that man was
first developed in the warm regions of the western or
Atlantic portion of the Old World, somewhere within
the present or ancient area of Africa, and not in Asia,
has been steadily strengthened since the great evolutionist
wrote his remarkable work on the <cite>Descent of
Man</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Quaternary Geography of Europe and Africa.</cite>&mdash;The
modification which I refer to is the obvious fact
that since the late tertiary epoch, and especially during
and after the glacial epoch, some material changes
have taken place in the physical geography of Europe
and Africa. To these I must now ask your particular
attention, as they controlled not only the scene of
man’s origin, but the lines of his early migrations.</p>

<p>When primal man, with no weapon or tool but one
chipped from a stone flake, roamed over France, England
and the Iberian peninsula, along with the rhinoceros,
the hippopotamus and the elephant, the coast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
lines of Europe and North Africa were quite unlike
those of to-day. England and Ireland were united to
the mainland, and neither the Straits of Dover nor St.
George’s Channel had been furrowed by the waves.
Huge forests, such as can yet be traced near Cromer,
covered the plains which are now the bottom of the
German Ocean. In the broad shallow sea to the
north, the mountainous regions of Scandinavia rose as
islands, and between them and the Ural Mountains its
waters spread uninterruptedly.</p>

<p>To the south, Northern Africa was united to Southern
Europe by two wide land-bridges, one at the Straits
of Gibraltar, one connecting Tunis with Sicily and Italy.
The eastern portion of the Mediterranean was a
contracted fresh-water lake, pouring its waters into a
broad stream which connected the Atlantic with the
Indian Oceans. This stream covered most of the
present desert of the Sahara, the delta of Egypt, and a
large portion of Arabia and Southern Asia. Its northern
beach extended along the southern base of the
Atlas Mountains from the River Dra on the Atlantic
to the Gulf of Gabes in the Mediterranean; thence
northward between Malta and Sicily to the Straits of
Otranto; by the Ionian islands easterly till it intersected
the present coast-line near the mouth of the
Orontes; northeasterly to about Diarbekir, whence it
trended south and east along the foot of the Zagros
mountains to the Persian Gulf. From that point it
followed the present coast-line to the mouth of the
Indus, and thence pursued the base of the great northern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
mountain range to the mouth of the Ganges, covering
the north of Hindustan, while the southern
elevations of that spacious peninsula, as well as a large
part of southern and western Arabia, rose as extensive
irregular islands above the water. Toward them the
mainland of equatorial Africa extended much nearer
than at present. It included in its area the island of
Madagascar, and reached far beyond into the Indian
Ocean. Toward the north, peninsulas and chains of
islands, now the summits of the plateaus and mountains
of the central Sahara, reached nearly or quite to
the present shore-line of the Mediterranean, about
Tripolis.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>This disposition of the water left two great land
areas in the old world, probably not actually united
though separated only by narrow straits, one between
the modern Tripolis and Tunis, and another on the
northern Syrian coast. I represent these areas on the
accompanying map, not indeed minutely, but approximately.</p>

<p>The general accuracy of the contours delineated
are now fully recognized by geologists. They are attested
by the remaining beach-lines of this primitive
ocean, by the geographical distribution of its contemporary
fauna and flora, and by the proofs of elevation
and submergence along the shores and in the bottom
of the adjacent seas and oceans. The “great sink” of
the western Sahara, the vast “schotts,” or shallow saltwater
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
ponds south of the Atlas, the salt Dead Sea at
the bottom of a profound depression, prove that the
drying up of the ancient ocean is scarcely yet complete.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Outlines of the Eastern Hemisphere in the Early Quaternary.</span></p></div>

<p>So familiar have these ancient continental areas become
to geological students that they have been named
like a newly-discovered island or cape. The northern
continent has been called <i>Eurasia</i>, compounded of the
words Europe and Asia, and the southern <i>Indo-Africa</i>,
from a supposed union of India and Africa.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>Neither of these names is quite acceptable. The
former leaves out of account the connection of Europe
with Africa, which is of the first importance in the
study of early man; and the latter assumes a geographic
union between India and Africa, which is not
likely to have existed in the period of man’s life on
earth. I prefer the two names which I have inserted
on the map; <i>Eurafrica</i>, indicating the connection between
Europe and Africa, and <i>Austafrica</i>, designating
the whole of the continent south of the ancient dividing
sea. The name <i>Asia</i> should be confined to the
Central Asian plateau and the regions watered by the
countless streams which flow from it toward the north,
east and south.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p><cite>Relics of Man.</cite>&mdash;Such was the configuration of land
in the Eastern hemisphere when man first appeared.
We know he was there at that time. I have referred
to his rude stone (palæolithic) implements exhumed
from the river-drift of the Thames and the Somme, a
deposit which dates from a time when the hippopotamus
bathed in those rivers; still older seem some rough
implements discovered in gravel layers near Madrid,
Spain, deposited by some large river in early quaternary
times. The worked flints near Lisbon were manufactured
when a wide fresh-water lake existed where
now not a trace of it is visible on the surface, and according
to some archæologists, are the most ancient
manufactured products yet discovered.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>In numerous parts of North Africa, as near Tlemcen
in the province of Oran, and in Tunisia, the oldest
forms of stone implements have been found in place
beneath massive layers of quaternary travertin,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> and
in some of the most barren portions of the Libyan
desert, now utterly sterile, the travertin contains abundant
remains of leaves and grasses, along with chipped
flints, proving that at the recession of this diluvial sea
not only was the vegetation luxuriant, but man was
then on the spot, as a hunter and fisher.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>Not less certain is it that he was a most ancient occupant
of Austafrica. Chert implements of the true
“river-drift” type have been discovered “in place”
in quaternary stratified gravels near Thebes, and elsewhere
in the Nile valley; and in the diamond field of
the Cape of Good Hope, palæolithic forms have been
exhumed from diluvial strata forty or fifty feet below
the surface of the soil.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>From similar evidence we know that man spread
widely over the habitable earth in that remote time.
It is known to archæologists as the earliest period of
the Stone Age, and the implements attributed to it are
singularly alike in size and form. They seem to indicate
a race of beings who were unprogressive, lacking
perchance the stimulus of necessity in their mild climate
and with their few needs.</p>

<p><cite>The Glacial Age.</cite>&mdash;But a wonderful change took
place in their conditions of life. Slowly, from some
yet unexplained cause, mighty ice-sheets, thousands
of feet in thickness, gathered around the poles, and
collected on the flanks of the northern mountains.
With silent but irresistible might they advanced over
land and sea, crushing beneath them all animal and
vegetable life, changing the perennial summer of Eurafrica
to an Arctic winter, or at best to an Alpine
climate. The tropical animals fled, the plants perished,
and under the enormous weight of the ice-mass, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
ocean bottom in the north was depressed a thousand
feet or more. This in turn brought about material oscillations
in the land levels to the south. The bed of
the Mediterranean sank, that of the Sahara Sea slightly
rose, leaving the latter little more than a swamp,
while the former assumed the shape which we now see.</p>

<p>These alterations in the land areas and climatic conditions
exerted the profoundest influence on the destiny
of man. When with the increasing cold the other
animals native to warm regions had fled or perished,
he remained to encounter with undaunted mind the
rigors of the boreal climate. Instead of depressing or
extinguishing him, these very obstacles seem to have
been the spurs to his intellectual progress.</p>

<p>Men were still in the lower stages of culture, with
no knowledge of metal, not capable of polishing stones,
without a domestic animal or trace of agriculture.
Yet everywhere these artisans possessed skill and
sentiments far above that of the highest anthropoid
ape described by the zoölogist. They knew the use
of fire, they constructed shelters, they dwelt together
in bands, they possessed some means of navigating
streams, they ate both vegetable and animal food, they
decorated themselves with colored earth and ornaments,
they wielded a club, they twisted fibres into
ropes and strings, if occasion required they fastened
together skins for clothing. All this is proved by a
careful study of what tools and implements they have
left us.</p>

<p><i>Development into Races.</i>&mdash;Whatever may have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
the physical type of men at their beginning, in culture
they were upon the same level for a long while after
they had dispersed over the globe.</p>

<p>When, where and how did they develop into the
several distinct races that we now know?</p>

<p>We can answer these questions, not fully, but to
some extent.</p>

<p>Man developed into certain strongly marked sub-species
or races long before the dawn of history.
More than six thousand years ago the racial traits of
the black, the white, and the yellow races, and even of
their subdivisions, were as pronounced and as ineffaceable
as they are to-day. This we know from the
representations on the Egyptian monuments of the
third and sixth dynasties, from the comparative study
of ancient skulls, and from the uniform testimony of
the earliest writings, wherever we find them.</p>

<p>This permanent fixation of traits, this profound impression
of peculiar features, was probably no rapid
process, but a very slow one. It took place between
the close of the glacial epoch and the proto-historic
period. This interim gives time enough; at the lowest
calculation, it was twenty thousand years, while others
have placed it at a hundred thousand. The division
of the species into races unquestionably was completed
long before the present geologic period, and under conditions
widely diverse from those now existing.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>As within these wide limits of time we can reply to
the question when the races became such, so within
similar broad boundaries of space we can answer
where their peculiar types were developed.</p>

<p>At the dawn of history, all the clearly marked sub-species
of man bore distinct relations in number and
distribution to the great continental areas into which
the habitable land of the globe is divided. Nearly the
whole of Europe and its geographical appendix, North
Africa, were in the possession of the white race; the
true negro type was limited to Central and Southern
Africa and its appended islands; the yellow or Mongolian
type was scarcely found outside of Asia; and
the American sub-species was absolutely confined to
that continent.</p>

<p><i>The “Areas of Characterization.”</i>&mdash;In claiming that
each sub-species had its origin and developed its physical
peculiarities in the land areas here assigned to it,
the ethnographer is supported by the unanimous verdict
of modern zoölogical science. “Whatever be the
cause,” writes the Rev. Samuel Haughton, “the distribution
of fauna shows clearly that forces have been
at work, developing in each great continent animal
forms peculiar to itself, and differing from the animal
forms developed by other continents.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>In ethnography, those geographical areas whose
physical conditions have left a durable impress on
their human inhabitants have been called either “geographical
provinces” (Bastian) or “areas of characterization”
(de Quatrefages). I prefer and shall
adopt the latter as more indicative of the meaning of
the term. It signifies that like physio-geographical
conditions prevailing over a given area inhabited for
many generations by the same peoples have impressed
upon them certain traits, physical and psychical, which
have become hereditary and continue indeterminately,
even under changed conditions of existence.</p>

<p>This general law is the recognized basis of modern
scientific ethnography.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> It is open to numerous limitations,
and its application must never be made without
the consideration of accessory and modifying circumstances.
For instance, certain areas are much
more potent than others in the influence they exert on
man: some act more powerfully on his mind than on
his body, or the reverse; some peoples are more susceptible
to physical influences of a given class than
others; and the length of time required is variable.

<p>According to the analogy of other organic beings,
man would have been more impressible to his surroundings
in the early history of his existence as a
species, the young, either as an individual or a genus,
being more plastic than the old. Furthermore, in his
then condition of culture, or absence of culture, he
had less to oppose to the assaults of his environment.</p>

<p><i>Classification of Races.</i>&mdash;It is not possible in the
present status of the science of man to point out precisely
how the various conditions of the great continental
areas reacted on the homogeneous primitive
type to develop the races as we know them. The
same difficulty encounters us with other animals and
with plants. We know, however, that at the dawn of
history each of these areas was peopled by nations resembling
each other much more than they resembled
nations of any of the other areas.</p>

<p>In addition to the great continents there were many
lesser regions, peninsulas and islands, usually on the
borders of the main areas of characterization, where
intermingling of types was sure to arise, and other
types be formed, who in turn received some particular
impress from their environment.</p>

<p>These considerations prompt me to offer the following
as the most appropriate scheme in the present condition
of science for the subdivision of the species
Man into its several races or varieties.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The Eurafrican Race.</span>&mdash;<i>Traits.</i>&mdash;Color white,
hair wavy, nose narrow, jaws straight, skull variable,
languages inflectional, religions ideal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The Austafrican Race.</span>&mdash;<i>Traits.</i>&mdash;Color black,
hair woolly, nose flat, jaws protruding, skull long,
languages agglutinative, religions material.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The Asian Race.</span>&mdash;<i>Traits.</i>&mdash;Color yellowish
or brownish, hair straight, nose flat or medium, jaws
straight, skull broad and high, languages isolating or
agglutinative, religions material.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">The American Race.</span>&mdash;<i>Traits.</i>&mdash;Color coppery,
hair straight, nose narrow, jaws straight, skull
variable, languages incorporating, religions ideal.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">Insular or Litoral Peoples.</span>&mdash;<i>Traits.</i>&mdash;Color
dark, hair lank or wavy, languages agglutinative.</p>

<p>In this scheme the more prominent and permanent
traits are named first. While individuals of pure
blood can easily be found in all the races who do not
correspond in all particulars to these descriptions, I do
not hesitate to assert that ninety-five per cent. of the
whole of the pure blood of any of the races here classified
will correspond to the standards given.</p>

<p><i>Subdivisions of Races.</i>&mdash;The further subdivisions
of ethnography follow to some extent the important
doctrine of the “areas of characterization,” that is,
they are geographical; but as the classification of men
advances in minuteness, other considerations become
paramount, notably, language and government.
These elements allow us to subdivide a <i>race</i> into its
<i>branches</i>; a branch into its <i>stocks</i>; a stock into its
<i>groups</i>, and these again into <i>tribes</i>, <i>peoples</i>, or <i>nations</i>.</p>

<p>Classified in this manner, the human species presents
the subdivisions shown on the adjacent scheme:

<p>That these distinctions may be plain I append definitions
of the ethnographic terms employed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p><i>Race.</i>&mdash;A variety or sub-species of the species <i>Man</i>,
presenting a number of distinct and permanent (hereditary)
traits of the character above described.</p>

<p><i>Branch.</i>&mdash;A portion of a race separated geographically,
linguistically, or otherwise, from other portions
of the race.</p>

<p><i>Stock.</i>&mdash;A portion of a branch united by some
prominent trait, especially language, offering presumptive
evidence of demonstrable relationship. The
individual elements of a <i>stock</i> are its <i>peoples</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>group</i> consists of a number of these peoples who
are connected together by a closer tie, geographical,
linguistic, or physical, than that which unites the members
of the stock.</p>

<p>A <i>tribe</i> is a body of men collected under one government.
They are presumably of the same race and
dialect.</p>

<p>A <i>nation</i>, on the other hand, is a body of men under
one government, frequently of different languages and
races. Its members have no presumed relationship
further than that they belong to the same species.</p>

<p>There are some other terms the precise meaning of
which should be defined before we proceed, the more
so as there is not that uniformity in their use among
ethnographers which were desirable.</p>

<p>This very word <i>ethnos</i>, with its adjective <i>ethnic</i>, is
an example. What is an <i>ethnos</i>? I know no better
word for it in English than a people, as I have already
explained this word,&mdash;one of the elements of a stock all
whose members, there is reason to believe, have a demonstrable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
relationship. Thus we should speak of
the Aryan <i>stock</i>, made up of the Latin, Greek, Celtic
and other <i>peoples</i>. The relationship among the members
of a <i>people</i> is closer than that between the members
of a <i>stock</i>. <i>People</i> corresponds to the Old English
<i>folk</i> (German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Volk</i>), but <i>folk</i> in the modern
English scientific terms “folk-lore,” “folk-medicine,”
has acquired a different signification.</p>

<p><i>Culture</i> and <i>civilization</i> are other terms not always
correctly employed. The former is the broader, the
generic word. All forms of human society show
more or less culture; but civilization is a certain stage
of culture, and a rather high one, when men unite
under settled governments to form a state or commonwealth
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">civitas</i>) with acknowledged individual rights
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">civis</i>). This presupposes a knowledge of various
arts and developed mental powers.</p>

<p>Much attention was paid by older writers to dividing
the progress of culture into a number of stages or
stadia. One of these, an American author, Lewis H.
Morgan, suggested an elaborate scheme according to
which the periods of man’s development should correspond
with historical conditions of culture, and these
he divided into lower, middle and upper states of
savagery, barbarism, and civilization, each characterized
by the introduction of some new art.</p>

<p>The problem is far too complicated to admit of any
such mechanical solution. The possession of a given
art, as the bow and arrow, or smelting iron, does not
lift a people, nor is it an indication of their culture.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Peoples low in one point are high in others; they develop
along different lines, with scarcely a common
measure, and their place in a general scheme must be
determined by an exhaustive investigation of all their
powers and conquests, and perhaps a comparison with
some other standards than those which we have been
brought up to consider the best.

<p>These figures vindicate for the race the title I have
given it&mdash;Eurafrican.</p>

<p>More than this: the purest and finest physical specimens
of the white race always have been and <i>still are</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
found native to African soil; and the leading nations
of the race, those who have most contributed to its
glory, and to the advance of the civilization of the
world, either have resided in Africa or can be traced
to it as their ancestral home.</p>

<p><i>Types of the White Race.</i>&mdash;Let us first define the
characteristics, physical and mental, of the white race.</p>

<p>In one of its pronounced types, the individuals are
blondes, tall in stature, the eyes blue or grey, the hair
yellow or reddish and wavy, the beard full, the nose
narrow and prominent (leptorhin), the chin well defined,
the jaws straight (orthognathic), the skull long
(dolichocephalic) or medium, the eyes narrow (microsemes),
the supra-orbital ridges rather prominent, the
face moderately oval.</p>

<p>This is the typical appearance of the ancient Goths,
Teutons and Scandinavians, and of the modern
Swedes and Germans. It was also that of the ancient
Libyans, and is still preserved in the greatest purity
among their descendants in Morocco and Algiers;
hence I shall call it the Libyo-Teutonic type.</p>

<p>A second type is also tall in stature, but red-haired,
freckled complexion, the face and forehead broad,
the cheek bones prominent, the eyes nearly circular
(megasemes), the jaws and mouth projecting (prognathic),
the skulls broad and high (brachycephalic-hypsistenocephalic),
the chin square and firm.</p>

<p>This is the type we see preserved in some of the
Highland Scotch clans, and in the “Tuatha de Danann”
of Ireland, recalling the large-limbed and red-haired
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
“Caledonians” of Tacitus, and those ancient
Britons who, under Queen Boadicea, withstood so
valiantly the Roman legions. The Gauls or Cimbri
of Belgium and northern France were of this type,
and hence it has been called the “Cymric” type.</p>

<p>But there is a second Celtic type, also of vast antiquity,
claimed by some to be the only pure form. In
it the skull is also broad&mdash;broader than the former
variety; but the stature is undersized, the hair and
eyes dark-brown, the complexion brunette, the orbits
rounded, the forehead full. Modern representatives
of this type are the dark clans of the Highlanders, the
Irish west of the river Shannon, the Manx, the Welsh,
the Bretons of France, the Auvergnats, the Walloons
of Belgium and the Ladins of eastern Switzerland.</p>

<p>The most ancient known seats of these dark Celts
were in extreme western Europe and the isles adjacent.
This location points them out as one of the
oldest peoples in Europe, whether their presence is
explained by immigration or autochthonous descent.
Part of their possessions in early historic times was in
the Iberian peninsula, along the Cantabrian mountains
in northern Spain. Here they were in immediate contact
with members of the white race of a different
type, the Euscarians or Basques.</p>

<p>In them the stature is medium, the form symmetrical,
hair and eyes are dark but rarely black, the complexion
dark and sallow, the face oval, and the skull
long, the length being in the posterior (occipital)
region. Although the last mentioned is an important
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
distinction between the Celtic and the Euskaric skull,
there is unquestionably a closer resemblance physically
between the Celts and Basques, who speak
totally diverse tongues, than between the Celts and
Cymri, whose tongue was the same.</p>

<p>In these four typical groups from the extreme west
of Europe we find sharp contrasts within limited areas,
among peoples some of whom are unquestionably
consanguine. Two of the groups, the Teutonic and
Cymric, belong in color and hair and stature to the
blonde type, but differ profoundly in shape of skull
and facial bones; the two others belong to the brunette
type, but differ equally in osseous character. In
general physical traits the Celtic differs less from the
Euskaric than from the Cymric type, as was recognized
by the historian Tacitus.</p>

<p>These facts bring out an ethnic principle of importance&mdash;the
variability of traits within the racial
limits&mdash;and this becomes more marked as the race is
higher in the scale of organic development. No race
remains closer to its type than the Austafrican, none
departs from it so constantly as the Eurafrican.
Wherever we find the unmixed white race we find its
blonde and brunette varieties, its prognathic and
orthognathic jaws, its long-skulled and broad-skulled
heads.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> To establish genealogic schemes exclusively
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
upon these differences, as has been the work of so
many living anthropologists, is to build houses of
cards.</p>

<p>These contrasts are presented to us daily. The
researches of Virchow, De Candolle, Kollmann, and
many others, prove that in the same city, in the same
family, the children to-day are born brunettes or
blondes, dark or light eyed, to some degree broad or
narrow skulled, with but partial reference to their
parents’ peculiarities. The aberrant types are usually
about twenty per cent. of the whole. It seems generally
to have been so in the unmixed white race wherever
located.</p>

<p>All such variations, however, remain strictly within
the racial lines, and are not approximations to other
races. Each race retains to-day the characteristics of
its earliest representatives, so far as we know them.</p>

<p><i>Primal Home of the White Race.</i>&mdash;Where should
we look for these earliest representatives, for the primal
home of the Eurafrican race? The usual answer has
been “in Asia,” but now that answer is rejected by
all the younger and most earnest ethnologists.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>A steady stream of information has of late been contributed
by the sciences of linguistics, palæontology,
pre-historic archæology and racial anatomy, sufficient
to convince even the skeptical that not Asia, but the
western water-shed of the Eastern Continent, was the
area of characterization which developed this race with
its marked physical traits and singular mental endowments.
In the previous lecture I have shown you that
man himself probably came into being as such within
the limits of that region which I have described as
Eurafrica; and as its conditions were such as to foster
his transformation from some inferior primate, so they
continued, though profoundly altered, to favor his
growth, as they still do continue to-day. It is by no
mere accident or result of political manœuvres that
western Europe has for two thousand years produced
the mightiest nations and greatest minds of the earth.</p>

<p>The discussion of the precise locality where in Europe
the primitive man developed into the white race
has occupied many learned pens in the last score of
years. But by nearly all of them the discussion has
been limited to the birthplace of merely the Aryan
linguistic stock&mdash;an unfortunate narrowness of view,
which has prevented a comprehensive grasp of the
question at issue.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>The Aryan peoples present by no means the only,
nor yet the purest types of the white race. I have
seen quite as noble blondes among the Kabyles of the
Djurjura as in Denmark, quite as handsome brunettes
among the Basques of the Pyrenees as among the
Celts of France or the Italians. A broad construction
of the question must include all these, and in this
spirit I approach it.</p>

<p>We must search for the first abode, the primitive
“area of characterization” of the white race:</p>

<p>1. Where its most ancient residence and greatest
numbers were in earliest historic times.</p>

<p>2. Where the prehistoric remains prolong that residence
most remotely back.</p>

<p>3. Where the earliest forms of linguistic structure
continue to exist in large communities.</p>

<p>4. Where its purest types are retained in considerable
numbers.</p>

<p>5. Where the climatic conditions are favorable to
the physical traits of the race.</p>

<p>If we can select a locality in which all of these arguments
unite, the cumulative evidence is so powerful
that we may consider the question settled.</p>

<p>I have already shown that at the dawn of history
the white race possessed either in Europe or Africa a
far larger area than in Asia, and possessed it practically
exclusively. The most recent researches in
the pile dwellings of the Swiss lakes and the plain of
the Po show that the same race inhabited them from
the classic period of Greece to far back in the stone
age.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>The most ancient shell-heaps or kitchen-middens
on the shores of Portugal contain skulls of the peculiar
type of the Basques of to-day. The hiatus or gap
which was once supposed to exist between palæolithic
and neolithic culture in France has been bridged over
by numerous observations, showing that the same race
continued to live and grow there.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> As for language,
every linguist recognizes the agglutinative type of the
Basque, and the semi-agglutinative character of the
Berber as more antique forms than the inflectional
caste of Aryan or Semitic tongues. Nowhere else do
white tribes speak an agglutinative tongue, except a
few in the Caucasus, where we know they settled at
a comparatively recent period.</p>

<p>The purest types of the whites in any large number
have always been found in Western Europe and Northwestern
Africa. There the blondes were represented
by the Suevi, the Goths, the Vandals, the Cymri, the
Berbers; the brunettes by the Euskarians, the Celts,
and the native Italic tribes. In the Orient, the Parsees,
the high-caste Brahmins, the Siagosch of the Hindu
Kusch, and some Caucasian tribes, have by close intermarriage
retained in a measure the traits of the race;
but confessedly not in the same distinctness as the
nations of Western Europe; nor do the Semitic peoples
of Asia present the purity of the type with anything
like the distinctness of the descendants of the
Libyans in the valleys of the Atlas. Finally, we do not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
anywhere in Asia find the physical conditions favorable
to the development of the white race&mdash;the moist,
cool, cloudy climate, the extensive shady forests covering
broad areas of low elevation, with absence of malaria
and diminished demand on the chylopoietic organs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="map_112" src="images/map_112.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Ethnic Chart of the Eurafrican Race.</span></p></div>

<p><i>Early Migrations and Subdivisions.</i>&mdash;It is not necessary
to suppose that the different peoples of the race
developed themselves from one central point. The
contrary is more probable.</p>

<p>Beginning at the extreme West of Europe, and its
appendix North Africa, the race pursued an easterly
course, divided by the great intervening sea of the
Mediterranean into two sections, which for convenience
I designate as the “North Mediterranean” and
the “South Mediterranean” branches, though it will
be seen that these geographical limits are not to be
taken absolutely.</p>

<p>The North Mediterranean branch embraces as its
most important member the Indo-Germanic peoples.
When first heard of in history, this stock extended
along the shores and islands of Europe from Cape
Finisterre to the Gulf of Finland, occupying all of
Central Europe and much of Asia Minor, the regions
of Modern Persia, and at a later date the southern
vales of the Himalayas. Its northern limits have always
been in contiguity with the Asian or Yellow
race. Stretch a line on the map from Singapore to
St. Petersburg, continue it to the Atlantic, and you
have roughly the ethnic boundary which has ever separated
the races, and does so to-day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>In western Europe, south of the Aryac was the
Euskaric stock, occupying central Spain, central and
southern France, portions of Italy, and various islands
in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>As speaking a language of a different family from
the prevailing inflectional type of the race, it is spoken
of as “allophyllic.” It does not stand alone in this
respect. Some of the white Caucasian tribes speak
similar agglutinative tongues, and it is supposed by
some that the ancient Pictish, Illyrian, Lycian, Van,
and Etruscan were of similar character. Probably
many such languages obtained which are now extinct.</p>

<p>The South Mediterranean Branch consists of two
related stocks, which have been called the Hamitic and
the Semitic. These names are not objectionable, in so
far as they indicate a distant genealogic unity, still recognizable,
between the two branches; but should not
in any way be accepted as acknowledging as historic
facts the myth of the Deluge and their origin in Asia.
The reverse is true. The migrations of both stocks
have been from west to east, and the two great
branches of the White Race entering Asia, the one
by the Bosphorus and the second by the Isthmus of
Suez, encountered each other after thousands of years
of separation in the region where the venerable myth
locates their point of departure.</p>

<h3>A. <span class="smcap">The South Mediterranean Branch.</span></h3>

<p>I shall begin my survey of the race and its distribution
with the South Mediterranean branch, as that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
which has been the more important of the two in history,
controlling by far the greater territory, and developing
the earlier and more potent civilizations. It
has ever been, and still is, the leader in intellectual
acumen, and the monuments of its achievements, both
in the realms of thought and action, remain unrivalled
in the world. With great propriety, therefore, it
claims our first attention.</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Hamitic Stock.</span></h3>

<p>The affinity between the Hamitic and Semitic stocks
is distinctly shown by their physical traits and the
character of their languages. The latter statement,
which was long in doubt, has now been acknowledged
by the most competent students, such as Friedrich
Müller and A. H. Sayce.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>Within their own lines the Hamites are divided into
three groups, the Libyan, the Egyptian and the East
African groups, each distinguished by physical and
linguistic differences.</p>

<h4><i>1. The Libyan Group.</i></h4>

<p>Of these the Libyan group occupies the region furthest
to the west, and presents the purest type of the
stock. From time immemorial it has occupied the
land from the Nile Valley to the Atlantic, and from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
Mediterranean to the Soudan. In the classical geographies
its tribes are referred to as Numidians, Libyans,
Mauritanians and Getulians, and at present they
are known as Berbers, Rifians, and Shilhas in Morocco,
the Tuariks and Tibbus of the desert, the Kabyles and
Zouaves in Algeria, the Ghadames, Serkus, Mzabites
of the south, the Senegas of Senegal, and many others.
The Guanches, who once inhabited Teneriffe, and are
now extinct, belonged to the Rifian tribes of this
stock,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> and the rulers of the once powerful empire of
Ghanata, which for centuries before the rise of Mohammedanism
controlled the valley of the Upper Niger,
were allied to the Moroccan family.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> Arab historians
of the seventh century tell us that at that time the
Berbers were “the lords of Maghreb (Africa), from
the Arabian Gulf to the western ocean, and from the
middle sea to the Soudan.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>The physical appearance of the Libyan peoples distinctly
marks them as members of the White Race,
often of uncommonly pure blood. As the race elsewhere,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
they present the blonde and brunette type, the
latter predominant, but the former extremely well
marked. Among the Kabyles in Algeria, I have seen
many fine specimens of blondes, with yellow hair,
light eyes, auburn beard, and tall stature. An English
traveller who visited last year some remote villages
in the mountains of Morocco, describes their
inhabitants as “for the most part fair, with blue eyes
and yellow beards, perfectly built and exceedingly
handsome men.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> This has been from the earliest
times the characteristic of the Libyans, and there is
abundant evidence that it was more general in former
centuries than it is now. The Guanches of Teneriffe
are described by the first voyagers as unusually tall
and fair, their yellow hair reaching below their waists.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>The Greek poet Callimachus, who was librarian of
the famous library at Alexandria two hundred and
fifty years before the Christian era, applies the same
adjective ξανθος, blonde or auburn, to the Libyan women,
which Strabo and other Greeks do to the Goths and
blonde Celts of Germany.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>Long before this, again, in monuments of the XIXth
dynasty of Egypt, the Libyans are painted as of a pronounced
blonde type, with light eyes and skins, and
are mentioned by a term which signifies fair or
blonde.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> The extended researches of ethnologists on
this point have accumulated a mass of facts proving
that the ancient Libyans were in appearance strikingly
similar to the North Germans and Scandinavians, having
a fair skin, yellow or auburn hair, blue or grey
eyes, full blonde beards, the face medium, the skull
dolichocephalic, the orbital ridges prominent, the chin
square and firm, forehead vertical or slightly retreating,
the stature tall, and the body powerful.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>This identity of type impressed me very much
among the Kabyles, and I note that the German ethnologist,
Quedlinfeldt, who was among the Berbers in
Morocco lately, writes of them: “I very often met individuals
with flaxen hair and blue eyes, who in face
and form corresponded perfectly to the ordinary type
of our North German people.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> For this reason, I
give it the name of the “Libyo-Teutonic” type.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>In the pure-blooded clans who still dwell in the
fastnesses of the Atlas and the Djurdjura, this antique
type is that which is general; but in the valleys, in the
desert and in Tunisia the type is darker, having been
corrupted by admixture with negro, Arabic and other
stocks.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> The fact which I wish especially to impress
on you is that nowhere do we find a purer type of
the white race than in northern Africa, and that this
was recognized by the earliest writers and records as
that especially belonging to this stock.</p>

<p>The languages spoken by the various Libyan peoples
prove on examination to be dialects of one tongue,
all so much alike that a few days’ practice will enable
the speaker of any one of them to express himself in
another. In its grammatical formation, it is inflectional
with agglutinative tendencies. Its radicals are
made up of consonants, the indications of time and
place being formed by changes in the vowel sounds.
In this respect it resembles the Semitic tongues, but
differs from them in having radicals of one, two, three,
or four consonants, while they have usually those of
three consonants only. In many other respects it presents
analogies to the Semitic dialects, of such a nature
that these latter seem to have developed themselves
out of conditions of speech as represented by
the Libyan. Hence some writers have called it and
its allied tongues “proto-Semitic languages.” It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
stands in distinct relation to the Coptic or ancient
Egyptian, and to some East African dialects.</p>

<p>The Libyans have possessed from time immemorial
the country in which we find them. They are its
indigenous inhabitants&mdash;all others, as Carthaginians,
negroes and Arabs, being demonstrably intruders.
Can we obtain any clue to their monuments in prehistoric
times by the aid of archæology and linguistics?
Some able students have thought they could,
and have brought forward some singular surmises.
There is a series of structures of huge stones, called
dolmens, menhirs and cromlechs, extending over
northern and central France, southern England, northern
Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algiers, and central
Tunisia. They are much alike, and seem to have
been constructed by some one people in very ancient
times. The skulls in them are often long, like those
of the Libyans and Teutons. Hence several French
writers have suggested that the ancestors of the white
Libyans moved from central Europe into Morocco,
along the line of these megalithic structures.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>In spite of a good deal of severe criticism, there remains
much in favor of the view that these remains
mark a route by which some neolithic people extended
their conquests. But it seems to me the trend of migration
was in the other direction, <i>toward</i> the east,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
and not from it. The white race began as such during
the glacial epoch; it could scarcely have developed
north of the Pyrenees, for the climate was so cold that
the reindeer, which to-day cannot breed in Stockholm,
found a suitable home in the valley of the Garonne.
The Iberian peninsula and the Atlas at that time possessed
climatic conditions about like those of Great
Britain to-day.</p>

<p>In that peninsula, at that time connected with Morocco
by a land bridge at the straits of Gibraltar, are
the oldest forms of languages spoken by the race, the
Euskaric dialects. There is reason to believe that at
the dawn of history these occupied the centre of the
peninsula; north of them, in the Cantabrian mountains
and along the shores of the Bay of Biscay, were
the Celtiberians, the rearguard of the migratory hordes
of Aryans; and along the southern shores and in North
Africa extended the tribes whose direct descendants
are the Libyan peoples. The name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iberi</i>, Iberians
applied by the ancients to the inhabitants of the eastern
and southern shores of Spain, testifies to this. It
means in the Libyan tongue <i>freemen</i>, and in the plural
form <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">berberi</i> or Berbers, is that by which the old
Egyptians knew them, and which from the same root
is their own favorite designation to-day.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>That the Iberians were Hamites, and not Basques,
has long been suspected, and is plainly the opinion to
be derived from the statements of the ancients and the
presence of Libyan proper names in the south of
Spain.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>When the Berber chieftain Tarik crossed the straits
in the seventh century, and gave to the great rock his
name (Gibraltar, Djebel-el-Tarik), he was but returning
to seize anew the land from which his ancestors
had been driven by Carthaginians and Romans.</p>

<p>From the remotest times the Libyans have had the
same form of government&mdash;village communities,
united by loose bonds into federations. The Egyptians
referred to them as “the Nine Bows,” or Bands,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
the Romans as the “Quinquigentes,” the Five Peoples,
the Arabs as “Qabail” or Kabyles, Confederates.
These confederations were sufficiently powerful,
even so far back as 1400 years before Christ, to
put in the field an army of 30,000 or more men for an
attack on Egypt; and that the general culture of their
country was quite high is shown by the character of
the spoils obtained by the Egyptians&mdash;horses, chariots,
vessels of brass, silver, copper and gold, swords, cuirasses,
razors, etc.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>At that date the nations of the North Mediterranean
branch were yet in the stone age, and the sites of
Greece and Rome were the homes of savages.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>It is probable that this defeat of the Libyans by
the armies of Rhamses gave a serious shock to their
progress, by disintegrating their growing state. It
appears that about this time there were various colonies
which migrated to sites on the northern shores of
the Mediterranean. One of these I have believed to
be the Etruscans, who settled on the west coast of
Italy about 1200 years before our era. They were
tall blondes, dolichocephalic, speaking an un-Aryan
language, and by their traditions came by sea from
the south.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>The Libyans were at times partially under the dominion
of the kings of Egypt, and many of them entered
the Egyptian armies as mercenaries. They allowed
the Phenicians peaceably to found the great city
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
of Carthage on their shores, and from these early colonists
they learned the art of writing. The alphabet
which is still preserved among some of their hordes
is derived from the Punic letters.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> When Carthage
fell, Rome seized the mastery of the coasts and productive
valleys, but her legions never penetrated to
the inland fastnesses. When the great empire tottered
to its fall, Goths and Vandals poured across and
over the straits of Gibraltar to found an ephemeral
empire in Africa; but these cavalry soldiers, knowing
to fight only on horseback, scarcely touched the
confines of the Libyan mountain homes. Even the
Arabs, sweeping resistlessly across their land in the
beginning of the eighth century, failed to penetrate
many of these fastnesses. To this day no Arab dares
venture into the land of the Rifian Berbers, and many
a tribe of the Djurjura keeps its customs and its blood
unaltered by the Koranic laws, or the Semitic intruders,
or the Code Napoleon of the French invaders.</p>

<p>The ancient elements of their culture are still largely
retained. Among the Kabyle and Touareg tribes of
to-day, in spite of the liberty authorized by Islam,
monogamy is the almost invariable rule, the women
are not only respected, but generally possess most of
the property, and prostitution is unknown. They are,
moreover, usually the learned class, and most of the
“tifinar” manuscripts come from the hands of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
fair scribes.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> As to the general character of the Berbers
of Morocco, we may take Sir Joseph Hooker’s
word when he tells us that they are “decidedly superior
in intelligence, industry and general activity to
their neighbors.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>The wander-loving Libyan tribes pursued other
journeys far to the east. Following the coast of the
Mediterranean, they formed settlements on the Syrian
shore, and extended their possessions into the Mesopotamian
valley, and north into the mountain vales of
Asia Minor. The Phenicians and Canaanites, the
Amorites, who were blonde Berbers of true Libyan
type, the Hittites, and the old Assyrians, who were the
builders of Babylon and Nineveh, were of Hamitic
stock, as is shown by the accordance of the ancient
biblical statement with modern linguistic and archæological
research.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>From these culture-centres of the Hamitic stock
followed the mighty stream of human progress back
along the southern shores of the Mediterranean to Cyrene
and Carthage, and along its northern shores to
Cyprus, Greece, Italy and beyond; while the Accadian
and Summerian learning, preserved for all time in the
cuneiform writing, made its beneficient influence felt
far into India and China, and reacted beneficially on
the older wisdom of Egypt, from which it had at first
largely drawn its inspiration.</p>

<h4><i>2. The Egyptian Group.</i></h4>

<p>From this all too hasty survey of this most ancient
people we must turn to another, akin to it, which has
played an important, yes, the most important part in
the culture-history of our species. I refer to the ancient
Egyptians. They belonged to the Hamitic stock,
but wandering eastward from its primal seats certainly
more than ten thousand years before our era,
had possessed themselves of the Nile valley from the
mouth of the stream quite up to and beyond the first
cataract.</p>

<p>Their kinship to the Libyans is proved by numerous
linguistic identities between the ancient Coptic
and the Libyan dialects, and by their physical appearance.
In color they are yellowish-white, passing to a
reddish-brown though the women who are not exposed
to the sun would pass in Europe as merely
dark brunettes. In the bony structure, the skull, the
face, and the proportions, they assimilate entirely with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
the white race and the Libyan type. This has been
shown by the researches of Virchow and others.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>The ancient Egyptian is represented to-day by the
modern Fellah or field-laborer of the Nile. The type
has been very well preserved, for though the riches
of this wonderful valley have attracted myriads of
foreigners in peace and war from the earliest times, all
have suffered greatly in longevity and fertility compared
to the native population. This type is of
medium stature, the limbs and body symmetrical and
delicately moulded; the skull is long, the face oval,
the hair dark and straight, or slightly curly; the eyes
are brown and small, the nose straight, the lips rather
full, the mouth small, the chin not prominent, the
beard scanty.</p>

<p>In all respects, in the pure Copt we must recognize
a delicate, thorough-bred member of the Eurafrican
race, in spite of his reddish-brown hue. These traits
are to be explained by the narrow limits of the Nile
valley, shut in by trackless deserts from the rest of
the world. Here for thousands of years lived this
stock, closely intermarrying, and under climatic conditions
of singular uniformity.</p>

<p>Whether they were the first inhabitants of the valley
has not been ascertained. Certain it is that at a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
period long before the date we usually assign to Egyptian
civilization, a people dwelt on the Nile ignorant
of any implements but those of rough stone. Their
relics have been found in the stratified gravels of the
hills, and on the summits of the arid plateaus.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> I
know no reason, however, to suppose that the tribes of
the Egyptian stone age were other than the ancestors
of those who were brought under the control of the
founder of the first dynasty, the historic king Mena.</p>

<p>This was about 4000 B. C. But previous to him
the ancient Egyptian priests claimed some 25,000 years
of occupation under various gods and demi-gods; and
the general accuracy of their claim I am not prepared
to dispute.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> Certainly the culture of lower Egypt
must have been at a high level for thousands of years
before the date of Mena, or he could never have established
the state which we know he did. From all that
archæology has yet taught us, we must place the beginnings
of Egyptian civilization earlier than that in
the valley of the Yang tse Kiang, earlier by far than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
any other on the globe. Its streams have permeated
all the lands to which the Eurafrican race have extended;
fecund as the waters of its own Nile, its elements
have nourished and developed the best intellectual
powers of the race through all subsequent
ages; to it we owe the seeds of our arts, the germs of
our sciences, the forms of our religion, the schemes of
our literatures, and the inestimable boon of our written
language. Look where you will among the most ancient
remains of the Old World culture, you find the
impress of Egypt’s Land and mind&mdash;in Etruscan
tombs, in Guanche mummy caves, in treasure houses
of Mycenæ, in Cypriote vaults, in Assyrian mounds,
under Carthagenian foundations.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> The species Man
owes nowhere else such gratitude as to these African
nations of the Eurafrican race.</p>

<p>The Egyptian presents the best known and complete
type of the psychical traits of the Hamitic stock.
Unideal, laborious, utilitarian, he was devoted to material
progress and the gross animal enjoyments of life.
His preferred employment was agriculture, his favorite
art the huge in architecture, his religion was a
polytheism with numberless images and pictures, his
pleasures were those of the appetite, his hopes of immortality
were bound up with the preservation of the
present body.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<h4><i>3. The East African Group.</i></h4>

<p>The singular uniformity of the Egyptian type does
not allow us to divide it into several branches, and on
account of its segregated position, it does not seem to
have had much intercourse with the east African
group of the Hamitic stock, living to the south of it.</p>

<p>At present this east African group of the Hamites
includes the Bedjas and Bilins between the Nile and
the Red Sea, the Afars or Danakils near the mouth of
the Red Sea, Gallas and Somalis between the gulf of
Aden and the Indian ocean, and the adjacent tribes of
the Agaouas, Adals, Khamirs, and others. In appearance
these peoples are usually reddish brown in
color, with dark wavy hair, of moderate stature and
symmetrical form, the face oval and the skull moderately
long, the nose aquiline and the chin well shaped,
and heavier built than the Egyptians.</p>

<p>Their life is principally nomadic, living in tents of
skin, and governed by chiefs who rule over small
communities. The descent is reckoned and property
passes on the female side. Some are Mahommedans,
but hold the faith lightly, and like the Kabyles, attach
more importance to the customs of their clan than to
the precepts of the Prophet. In many parts they
betray admixture with the Negro tribes to whom they
are neighbors, and from whom they have always obtained
slaves.</p>

<p>Thus the Danakils are described as sooty black,
with scanty beards, thin calves, and thick lips, but with
features and hair in other respects quite European,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
their faces rarely prognathic, and their bodies symmetrical.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
The Somalis are lighter in color, but like the
Danakils, do not cultivate the soil nor establish fixed
abodes.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Semitic Stock.</span></h3>

<p>Owing to the unreasoning acceptance of myths as
history, it is generally believed that the Semites originated
in Asia. From what I have already said you
will appreciate that such an opinion is quite inconsistent
with modern research. We may, at the most, concede
that the peculiar form of their language and certain
physical traits were developed during their long
residence in the peninsula of Arabia, where history
first finds them. But that they entered Arabia in remote
pre-historic times from Africa, and not from
Asia, is now acknowledged by an increasing number of
learned and unprejudiced writers.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>There is a difference of opinion whether this immigration
was by the way of the Isthmus of Suez or the
Straits of Bab el Mandeb, but the course of their wanderings
in Arabia seems to have been from north to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
south, the Ethiopian Semites being distinctly emigrants
from the other side of the Red Sea. Hence
the probability is that the ancestors of the ancient
Arabians wandered from the Libyan plateau, or the
eastern Atlas, through the Delta into the region of the
Sinaitic mountains, whence they spread south and
east, forming several distinct groups.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<h4><i>1. The Arabian Group.</i></h4>

<p>The first of these included the Arabians proper. At
a very early period they became divided into a northern
and southern portion, the former represented by
the Ishmaelites and Bedawins, the latter by the ancient
Himyarites, Sabeans and Nabotheans, and the
modern Ehkili and kindred clans. The Himyaritic
nations had important cities, and possessed a written
literature at least 700 B. C., and probably much
earlier.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> The Queen of Sheba, who paid a memorable
visit to King Solomon, came from one of these cities,
and her journey is strong testimony to the admiration
for learning which prevailed in her land, and which
she so evidently fostered.</p>

<p>At that time, and for centuries afterwards, there
were few parts of the world more favored than the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
southern portions of the peninsula. It was known as
“Arabia felix,” Araby the Blest, and was famed for
its abundant products, its spices and perfumes, and the
wealth and luxury of its inhabitants. Some change
of climate apparently, and the inroads of the Ishmaelitic
hordes, quite destroyed this happy condition about
the fifth century, A. D. The Himyaritic language
disappeared, the cities were laid waste, many of the
people migrated to Africa or sank into despised outcasts,
as the present Ehkili of the Hadramaut. In
this manner the whole of the great peninsula fell under
the control of the true Arab.</p>

<p>It is he who preserves in his language the oldest and
purest form of Semitic speech, and in mind and body
its most pronounced mental and physical type. He is
rather tall (1.65), his face oval, the nose straight or
aquiline, the features sometimes singularly noble and
prepossessing, the skull long (index 73°-75°), the
complexion ruddy rather than brown, when due allowance
is made for the tan, and the hair slightly wavy
or straight. Crisp hair is looked upon with disapproval,
as indicating mixed and ignoble blood.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> In temperament
the Arab is abstemious, and his powers of
physical endurance are phenomenal. His mental temperament
is that of an idealist; he has added nothing
to the grand creations of plastic art, nothing to inventions
of utility in life, nothing to the marvels of architecture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
or the beauties that appeal to the senses; he
cares neither for history nor the drama. In his dreams
he conquers the world, and it falls at his feet; in fact,
his greatest states have been ephemeral bubbles.</p>

<p>Yet his dreams have been realized. The Semite has
conquered the world, and it is at his feet. Twice have
arisen among his people majestic forms, before whom
all civilized nations bow, Jesus and Mahomet.</p>

<p>The religious idealism which led the Semite in the
days of Moses to reject the images of stone and wood
and proclaim that God is one, overawed in its later
expressions the whole of the white race, and now extends
its sway to the farthest seas.</p>

<p>Though the Aryan to-day may dislike the Semite
and doubt of the God whom he preached, let him not
forget that the first vivid impression of such a great
idea came from the Semitic stock. If in his marts,
his diplomacy and his learned professions, he finds the
Semites still pressing him aside, let him remember
that this is the people whose destiny seems to be to
own no country, but to rule all.</p>

<h4><i>2. The Abyssinian Group</i></h4>

<p>Of tribes is evidently descended from fugitives from
the Arabian peninsula. The Ethiopians, or Geez
(a word meaning emigrants), speak a dialect the nearest
related to the Himyaritic of the inscriptions. It
has a literature and an ancient alphabet of its own.
The Tigre, the Massawa, the Amhara, and, further to
the south, the Harrari, are Semitic dialects, more or
less akin to the Ethiopic.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p>The period when this migration took place is not
precisely known, but it was at a calculable period before
the beginning of our era. Quite likely it was
about the time of the dissolution of the Joktanide
monarchy in the Hadramaut. There can be no question
but that the course of migration at this point was
from Arabia into Africa.</p>

<p>The Tigre is the predominant nation of North
Abyssinia, the Amhara in the south of that region.
The Harrari extends into the land of the Somalis.
All these are of Himyaritic descent, but near them
are a number of later Arab tribes who speak dialects
of the modern Arabic. These are the Jalin about
Khartoum, and others near Senaar and Baqqara, west
of the Nile. There are also many Jews, who have
inhabited the country from the early centuries of our
era.</p>

<p>An infusion of negro blood is visible in much of
the population. Their color is dark brown, the hair is
crisp, and the features are negroid. Where this
mingling is absent, the color is a light or bright
brown, the face oval, the nose thin, lips not at all
thick, and the hair wavy and straight. In other
words, the features are truly European, framed in a
brown setting.</p>

<p>The Abyssinians proper have always been an agricultural,
pastoral and manufacturing people. The
soil is fertile and the climate temperate, but there are
no large rivers, and communication is difficult. The
crops are barley, dates, millet, sugar-cane, etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
Formerly the country was under one ruler, who was
called the Grand Negus. The late “Negus,” Theodoras,
could put in the field over fifty thousand fighting
men, and made himself so obnoxious to Europeans
that the English sent an expedition against him in
1868, and he perished under the ruins of his capital,
Magdala.</p>

<p>From the fourth century the principal religion in
Abyssinia has been Christianity, but in a corrupt form,
mixed with the ancient heathen observances, such as
ceremonies at the rise of certain stars, and veneration
of holy stones and springs. The clergy are numerous,
estimated at about 72,000, and exert a leading
influence in the state. There are many monks and
nuns living in cloisters, and possessing extensive
holdings. The church service is conducted with an
effort at pomp, and there is a considerable sacred
literature, of very little value. The influence of the
religious teaching on the people is scarcely visible
except in making them fanatical, superstitious and
averse to enlightenment. Abyssinia thus presents the
picture of a country which for more than 1500 years
has been a Christian state, and where Christianity has
wholly failed to render the people moral, intelligent
or pure.</p>

<h4><i>3. The Chaldean Group.</i></h4>

<p>The third group of the Semites was the Chaldean,
including the Syrians and Arameans, the later Assyrians
and Babylonians, the Israelites, Samaritans
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
and Jews. All these were from early times deeply
tinged with other blood. The Syrians and Chaldeans
removed first from the Arabian peninsula, and their
dialects depart the furthest from the pure stock.
Abraham, the traditional ancestor of the Israelites, left
northeastern Arabia for Mesopotamia about 2000
B. C., to dwell in “Ur of the Chaldees,” a city near
the mouth of the Euphrates. Already the Chaldees
had secured from the older Hamitic settlers a portion
of Mesopotamia, and gradually extended their conquests.</p>

<p>Many of the Syrians united with the Hamitic residents
on the coast, so that the Phœnicians became
largely Semitized. All these nations were in constant
intercourse with the highly developed civilization of
Egypt, as is shown by the Mosaic books, and from that
source derived most of the germs of their intellectual
growth. In spite of their love of travel and commerce,
in spite of their dispersion over the earth, this group
has retained a striking individuality. Many ethnographers
charge it against the Jews that the presence
of blondes among them, and of brachycephalic heads,
proves a crossing of the blood. This is not the case.
The Semitic stock is a markedly white type of the
race, and in all ages fair complexion, light eyes and
hair, have been admired as especially beautiful. This
is repeatedly referred to in the Hebrew Scriptures, and
is shown by observation among these people at the
present day.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

<p>The physical type of the Jew is well known and
unmistakable; wavy hair, dark or blonde, full beard,
eyes soft, nose prominent, rather heavy, with an accentuated
and peculiar outline, lips full, face oval, skull
medium or long. Nor are his mental traits less familiar;
a pliant, supple disposition, a distaste for physical
labor or the toil of the pioneer or soldier; deficiency
in personal courage; subtlety in monetary
transactions; quickness in applying social or individual
weaknesses to his own benefit; industry in intellectual
pursuits; love of display and of position; strong
devotion to family ties.</p>

<p>This is the Jew as we know him in the tussle of
modern life, a character prominent in all European and
American cities, without a nationality, in conflict with
the prevailing religion, suspected and disliked, but
wielding an influence out of all proportion to the
numerical strength of his people. It may be regarded
as continuing in his person that remarkable intellectual
superiority which the South Mediterranean Branch of
the white race has from the earliest time exerted on
the history of man.

<p>In my previous lectures I have shown with as much
detail as my time permits, that the original home
of the white race was in that portion of the Atlantic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
seaboard which I have called <i>Eurafrica</i>, and which
includes the present areas of northwestern Africa
and southwestern Europe. From this region, I have
pointed out, the race divided into two branches, the one
moving eastward, south of the Mediterranean sea, the
other in the same direction, north of this separating
stream. To-day we shall consider the ethnic history
of the latter.</p>

<h3>B. <span class="smcap">The North Mediterranean Branch.</span></h3>

<p>Unlike the South Mediterranean Branch, whose
languages present everywhere some degree of resemblance,
sufficient to predicate for them a remote common
origin, the North Mediterranean Branch includes
several stocks fundamentally diverse. They are the
Euskaric, the Aryac, and the Caucasic stocks. The
second of these is by far the most extended and
important; but, as I have previously observed, it does
not bear the impress of the highest antiquity, nor
yet is its location that where we should look for the
most ancient members of this branch. Both these
conditions are fulfilled by</p>

<h4><i>1. The Euskaric Stock.</i></h4>

<p>At present this contains but one group, the Basques,
residing in the valleys of the Pyrenees, on both the
Spanish and French frontiers. There is little doubt
from the linguistic studies of Humboldt and from the
researches of archæologists that the Basques once extended
widely throughout the present area of Spain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
and Portugal; but I am not inclined to identify them
with the Iberians of the classical geographers, for reasons
given in my last lecture. There is a great deal
of evidence that in proto-historic times they occupied
central and southern France, portions of Italy, Corsica,
Sardinia, perhaps Sicily, and some southern tracts
of England. Many believe that the ancient Aquitanians
and Ligurians, the Picts and Cantabrians, were of
this stock, as well as the pre-Aryac tribes of Greece.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>I described in my last lecture the Basques as representatives
of one of the dark types of the white race,
with a peculiarly shaped skull, elongated posteriorly.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>
The face is oval, the chin pointed and weak. The
general aspect indeed of a Basque cranium conveys
the impression of a feeble character, and such the
history of the people shows them to have been. They
never contributed anything to the advance of the race,
and from their earliest appearance in history have
been retiring before the pressure of sturdier nationalities.
At present they do not number over three
hundred thousand, and in a few generations will be
merged in the neighboring Spaniards and French.</p>

<p>The Basque language belongs to one of those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
primitive forms of human speech such as we find
among the Negroes of Central Africa, or the savage
tribes of Siberia. It is of that type called agglutinative
and polysynthetic, and in some points has the incorporative
tendency of American tongues. It is the
speech of a people whose ideas remained confined to
objective material relations. According to the latest
students, it is absolutely without connection with any
of the so-called Turanian (Ural-Altaic) languages,
and is equally remote from the Hamitic group.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>I now turn to</p>

<h4><i>2. The Aryac Stock</i></h4>

<p>of peoples and languages. It is sometimes called the
“Indo-European,” or “Indo-Germanic,” or “Celt-Indic”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
stock, and embraces the principal historic
nations of Europe, and in Asia the Armenians, Persians
and Hindostanees.</p>

<p><i>Origin of the Aryans.</i>&mdash;No ethnographic question
of late years has led to keener discussion than the
origin and affinities of these peoples. The theory
derived from the Hebrew myth of the Deluge, that
they migrated into Europe from Asia, was long accepted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
without question, and seemed to be strengthened
by the discovery that Sanscrit, the classical language
of India, and Zend, the ancient tongue of Persia,
are related to Greek, Latin and German.</p>

<p>But reflection and extended observation led to other
results. It was perceived that the majority of the
Aryac peoples had lived in Europe from the remotest
historic times, and only a small minority in Asia;
that some of the Aryac tongues of Europe retain more
ancient forms than either Sanscrit or Zend; that the
oldest traditions point to migrations from Europe into
Asia, and not the reverse; that these traditions are
supported by the Indian Aryans, who distinctly claim
that their ancestors migrated from the north into
India, and by the Persians, whose sacred book, the
Avesta, declares they were not the original owners of
Iran, and finally by an examination of the arts of the
pre-historic Europeans,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> and an exhaustive analysis of
the words common to all the dialects of Aryac speech,
which indicate that the ancestral tribe must have lived
in geographic surroundings not to be found in the
Aryac districts of Asia, but answering in all points to
the regions of central or western Europe.</p>

<p>I constantly see it stated in works on ethnology
and linguistics that the scientist who first advanced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
this opinion was the Englishman, Dr. Robert G.
Latham. Nothing is more erroneous. For a score
of years before he introduced it to the English public,
this view had been repeatedly and ably defended by
the eminent Belgian naturalist, d’Omalius d’Halloy.
He lost no opportunity of showing that the ancestors
of the modern Europeans did not come from Asia,
but belonged originally to the continent they now inhabit.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>Since his first promulgation of this theory in 1839,
the evidence in its favor has been slowly but steadily
accumulating, until now it numbers among its adherents
practically all the ethnologists of the day who do
not feel committed by their previous writings, or by
their creeds, to the Asian hypothesis. Among the
English writers who have recently treated the subject
with marked ability and much more fullness than is
possible for me at present, I mention Canon Isaac
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
Taylor and Professor A. W. Sayce; in Germany, O.
Schrader, Karl Penka, Theodor Pösche, L. Geiger,
and in France, M. de Lapouge, etc.</p>

<p>I shall not enter into a recital of these arguments,
for I believe the debate is so nearly terminated that
the conclusion may be accepted that the Aryac peoples
originated in Western Europe and migrated easterly.
This you will observe is in accord with the general
theory of the origin and distribution of the white
race which I laid before you, and is a potent argument
in its support.</p>

<p><i>The Aryac Physical Type.</i>&mdash;When we endeavor to
fix more precisely the home of that tribe which was
the lineal Aryac progenitor, several considerations
must be carefully weighed. The physical types of
the Aryac people differ markedly, as I stated in my
last lecture, and some writers (Penka, Lapouge, etc.)
have claimed that the Teutonic, the tall blonde type, is
peculiar to the Aryans, and must have been the original
character. But it is found with just as great purity
among the Libyans of Africa, so that the assumption
is vain.</p>

<p>It is an undeniable fact that at the earliest period,
both in Europe and Asia, the majority of Aryan-speaking
peoples were brunettes, and it is also a fact
that in the population of Europe to-day there is a
tendency to revert to that type. When a blonde and
a brunette intermarry, ten per cent. more children will
take after the brunette.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> There is a probability, therefore,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
that the original Aryac tribe was a mixture of
blondes and brunettes, with a majority of the latter,
and also that the form of its skulls was variable, some
long, some broad.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>This would indicate a mixed descent, and such, no
doubt, it owned. It is absurd to suppose the contrary.
The type of <i>the proto-Aryac language</i> is one which
originates not early, but late in the history of human
speech. The process of grammatical inflection is the
highest stage of linguistic evolution. It is the result
of a slow growth, in which the material elements of
language are transformed into formal elements, and the
“grammatical categories,” or parts of speech, gradually
assume logical distinctness and independent expression.
We can watch this growth in its imperfect
form in the Nahuatl of Mexico and the Berber of Morocco;
and when we see it completed, as in the Arabic
or Latin, we may be sure it is a comparatively late fruit
of the human intellect. The expressions common to
all Aryac languages reveal a primitive social condition
to correspond with this. It was above that of
savagery. These common ancestors had domesticated
dogs, cattle, and perhaps sheep; nomadic at times,
they at some seasons tilled the soil; they were acquainted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
with copper, and brewed mead from honey;
they had probably even invented a wagon, and milked
their cows, and they certainly lived on or near the seashore,
and used boats.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that the original inflected Aryac
tongue arose from the coalescing of two or more uninflected
agglutinative or semi-incorporative tongues,
the mingling of the speeches being accompanied, as
always, by a mingling of blood and of physical traits.
This explains the fact that has puzzled so many ethnologists,
that there is no fixed Aryac type.</p>

<p>Where should we look for this intermingling to have
taken place? From the arguments already advanced
you would naturally say, somewhere on the western
coast of Europe.</p>

<p>This is supported by an unexpected piece of evidence
of a strong character. The system of consonants
is undoubtedly the most persistent part of a language,
and there is no question but that the Celtic and
Lithuanian, of all the Aryac tongues, have kept most
closely to the primitive system of consonants once common
to them all.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> The Lithuanian is spoken by a
limited community on the coast of the Baltic sea, while
the Celtic, in proto-historic times, occupied the whole
of Great Britain and northern Belgium, France and
Spain. In the two latter areas it was from immemorial
time in close connection with the Euskaric
(Basque), and perhaps the Libyan (Berber) groups,
and it is possible that in comparatively late (neolithic)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
times the Aryac with its inflections might have been
developed from these partly agglutinative languages.</p>

<p>This suggestion is not so hazardous as it may seem.
William von Humboldt, one of the ablest linguists of
this century, suggested that the Basques and the
Celts, the Ligurians and the Gauls, in spite of the
contrasted structure of their languages, may have
sprung from the same ethnic trunk, and derived their
languages from a common source.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>Other scholars of eminence, such as Delitzsch, Ascoli,
Raumer, Schultze and Abel, have pointed out
numerous affinities between the Hamito-Semitic, Libyan,
old Coptic and Assyrian tongues, and the oldest
Aryac forms, and have argued for the existence of a
fundamental “proto-Ayro-Semitic” speech which existed
before the separation of the white race into its
northern and southern branches.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> There is evidence
that this very ancient tongue was of the “isolating”
character, with a tendency to agglutination by suffixes.</p>

<p>It is now recognized that inflection did not exist in
the primitive Aryac dialects, but was gradually developed
by means of such suffixes added to the stem, by
different processes in the different dialects, many of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
which are in activity to-day.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> These inflective processes
bear closer resemblance to the Libyan, which
has suffixes, and the old Egyptian, than to pure Semitic
tongues, which leads to the suggestion, again, that
the separation of the race was in the west rather than
the east.</p>

<p><i>Proto-Aryac Migrations.</i>&mdash;Leaving these speculations
as to the origin of the Aryac stock, let us sketch
its probable migrations, as indicated by linguistic research.
It appears to have divided early into two
main streams, the one occupying central and southern
Europe, the other moving eastward on a northerly
route, the two meeting as they neared the Bosphorus.</p>

<p>The central stream was of Celtic affinities. Its
tribes having possessed themselves of the coast line
from Cape Finisterre to the mouth of the Rhine and
the islands of Great Britain, passed up the valleys of
the Rhine and its affluents into southern Germany,
the valleys of Switzerland and the Tyrol, quite to the
Danube. Its easternmost tribes were probably the
Dacians.</p>

<p>The Aryac Italic peoples, the Umbrians, the Oscans,
the Latins, were the first offshoot of this southern migration;
not that they were directly descended from
the Celts, but that they sprang from the same division
of the primitive Aryac stock. This is still so clear
that I remember Matthew Arnold in his lectures on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
poetry quotes sentences from ancient Irish which are
also intelligible Latin.</p>

<p>A second offshoot was the Illyrians, who peopled
the northern and eastern shores of the Adriatic, the
ancestors of the modern Albanians.</p>

<p>A third was the Hellenic people, organized later
than the Latins, and imbued with elements quite foreign
to these.</p>

<p>The northern stream was the Letto-Slavic, whose
primitive home was on the shores of the German
Ocean north of the mouth of the Rhine, and in the
region which extends thence to the Gulf of Finland.
Its members presented the physical traits of the Libyo-Teutonic
type, contrasting in this to the traits of the
central and southern stream, who were of the dark
type of the race. The Cymric type seems to have
been a mingling of the two, and was found at or near
the boundaries between them.</p>

<p>At a comparatively late period&mdash;certainly after the
beginning of the bronze age, as we know from their
languages&mdash;the Teutonic tribes separated from the
Letto-Slavs, and moved into Central and South Germany,
where they remained. Numerous Slavonic
hordes, however, pushed eastward, some passing to
the north of the Black and Caspian Seas, where they
formed the ancient Sarmatians, others approaching
the Hellespont, where they mingled with Celtic and
other elements to make the Thracian and other peoples.</p>

<p>Passing into Asia across the Hellespont and Bosphorus,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
or along the coast in their vessels, or pursuing
the shores of the Caspian, numerous Aryac colonies
from the vanguard of the eastern emigrants wandered
into Asia. The Indo-Eranians that is, the ancient
Persians and Sanscrit speaking tribes, entered first and
progressed farthest, settling in Iran, and occupying the
land between the Caspian Sea and the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Later came the Phrygians and Armenians, who had
formerly lived in Thrace, crossing the Bosphorus and
establishing themselves in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>The dates of these occurrences can be fixed only approximately.
The Armenian migration was later than
700 B. C., as previous to that date the Vans, a people
of non-Aryac speech, occupied the region later known
as Armenia. The Brahmans crossed the Hindu-Kusch
into India, about 1500-2000 B. C., and the Persians
possessed themselves of Iran at least a thousand
years earlier.</p>

<p>We must not suppose that the languages of these
peoples developed one out of the other. That is not
the way languages grow. It was by contact in various
centres with various dialects and wholly different
linguistic stocks that the speech of these nomads was
altered. They did not journey always in one direction,
but to and fro, now rapidly advancing, now retreating,
now long stationary, ever through war, commerce
and marriage adding new elements to their
speech, each tribe developing its dialect with independent
material and on different grammatical principles.</p>

<p>We are now prepared to study the historic and
modern representatives of this important stock.</p>

<h4><i>1. The Celtic Peoples.</i></h4>

<p>The Celtic peoples of the present day form a decaying
group, which in a few generations will wholly disappear.
Two thousand years ago they were the most
important Aryac stock in central and western Europe.
Their sole representatives now are the Highland
Scotch, the Irish, the Manx, the Welsh, and the natives
of Brittany in France. In all these localities the
Celtic speech is losing ground before English or
French. In Ireland about 900,000 persons can speak
Irish, but not more than 150,000 are ignorant of English.</p>

<p>These Celtic groups form two dialects, one spoken
in Scotland, Ireland and the Isle of Man, known as
<i>Gaelic</i>, the other common to Wales, Brittany, and in
the last century to Cornwall, called <i>Armorican</i> or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
<i>Cymric</i>. The Irish possessed a sparse literature going
back to the eighth century, and the Welsh to the
twelfth, while the oldest Scotch or Breton songs date
at the furthest from the fourteenth century, in spite of
assertions to the contrary.</p>

<p>To this day the Celtic peoples present the same contrast
of physical type that they did to the Romans.
Some of the Scotch clans, many of the Irish, most of
the Welsh and Bretons, are of moderate stature, dark
eyes and hair, and brunette complexion, while the remainder
are tall, raw-boned, red-haired, with florid,
freckled skins and tawny beards.</p>

<p>Their mental traits are quite as conspicuous; turbulent,
boastful, alert, courageous, but deficient in
caution, persistence and self-control, they never have
succeeded in forming an independent state, and are a
dangerous element in the body politic of a free country.
In religion they are fanatic and bigoted, ready
to swear in the words of their master, rather than to
exercise independent judgment. France is three-fifths
of Celtic descent, and this explains much in its history
and the character of its inhabitants.</p>

<h4><i>2. The Italic Peoples.</i></h4>

<p>The principal Aryac tribes who possessed themselves
of the Italian peninsula were the Umbrians in
the north, and the Samnites (or Oscans) and Latins in
the south. They conquered in time the Etruscans,
Ligurians, Volscians and others of non-Aryac lineage,
and laid the foundation for the mighty Aryac Empire
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
of Rome, destined to command the world, and to introduce
the Latin tongue as the dominant speech of
Southern Europe.</p>

<p>From the Latin speaking Roman colonies have
sprung the <i>Romance languages</i> of modern times and
the existing “Latin peoples.” These include the
modern Italian, the French, the Spanish, the Portuguese,
the Roumanian, the Wallachian, and the Ladinish
in Switzerland, besides a number of dialects.
Through the conquests of the European Romance nations,
their tongues have gained the ascendency over
the whole continent of America south of the United
States, over a large part of Canada and North Africa,
and over many islands. To-day, the speech of imperial
Rome, more or less modified, prevails over an area
five times as great as that of the empire in the zenith
of its glory.</p>

<p>Like the language, the physical type of the ancient
Italic peoples indicated their near relationship to the
dark Celts. The Latin and Umbrian skulls were short
or rounded (brachycephalic), the stature medium, the
hair dark and curly, the eyes brown or black, the nose
aquiline, the complexion brunette. In later generations
this type was modified by mixture with the
blonde or long-skulled Etruscans, and the numerous
foreigners who came to live in Rome; but to this day
it is that which prevails throughout the peninsula.</p>

<p>None of the Romance nations can boast of much
purity of descent. After the fall of the Western Empire
(476 A. D.), hordes of Germans poured into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
Italy; they also overran France and Spain, while
Arabs and Berbers occupied for generations nearly
the whole of the Iberian peninsula, the island of Sicily,
and portions of France. The Roumanians are partly
Slavonic, and the Portuguese have Celtic and Basque
blood.</p>

<p>Tn spite of these admixtures, the Romance peoples
have retained many of the mental features of the old
Romans. In government they display the same acknowledgment
of authority, love of system and bureaucratic
forms of administration, which made the
Roman municipium the wonder of the world; in religion,
they cultivate the same respect for external
show and material rites rather than for the ideal aspects
of faith; and in literature, it is only in later
days that they have declared independence from the
models of classicism, which too long fettered their
best minds.</p>

<p>The ancient Romans had little idealism. They
achieved nothing in poetry, philosophy or the plastic
arts. It was owing to the Hellenic and Semitic influence
that, under the Empire, Rome became the centre
of artistic, as of all other training. These acquired
qualities have been transmitted to the Romance nations,
and it is to them we owe nearly all that is best
in art down to the beginning of the present century.
The sentiment of symmetry is native to them, and
one has but to compare either the scientific works or
the public buildings of France with those of Germany
during the last five-and-twenty years to be convinced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
how the sense of form is present in the former and defective
in the latter.</p>

<h4><i>3. The Illyric Peoples.</i></h4>

<p>The ancient Illyrians were the ancestors of the
modern Albanians, a people numbering in all nearly
two million souls, occupying a portion of western
Turkey, bordering on the Adriatic Sea, about 40°
north latitude. They are scarcely more than semi-civilized,
and neither in ancient nor modern times
have they taken any prominent part in the history of
Europe. Their language undoubtedly belongs to the
Aryac stock, and has various affinities with Greek and
Latin, but is a long-separated and almost isolated fragment
of Aryac speech. The national name they give
themselves is Skypetars, which means mountaineers.
They are also known as Arnauts.</p>

<p>The physical type of the Albanians is mixed, those
to the south being chiefly blondes, to the north brunettes;
their skulls are generally long, their stature
tall, their bodies muscular. Some of them are Mohammedans,
others Roman Catholics, while others
belong to the Greek church. In disposition they are
turbulent and warlike, caring little for the amenities
of civilization.</p>

<p>The nearest related groups to the Illyrians are believed
to have been the Thracians, who were a blonde
people, the Dacians, who were largely Celtic, and the
Macedonians. Some recent writers have argued that
the ancient Japyges were Illyrians, and had occupied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
most of the peninsula of Italy previous to the arrival
of the Latins;<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> but this question remains obscure.</p>

<h4><i>4. The Hellenic Peoples.</i></h4>

<p>It is acknowledged even by those who maintain the
Asiatic origin of the Aryans that the Greeks entered
the peninsula and the adjacent isles of the Ionian and
Egean seas from a northwesterly direction.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> It has
been also argued “from the unmixed character of
their language” that they found the region uninhabited,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>
but there are reasons for believing that it was
sparsely populated by a non-Aryac people of the Euscaric
physical type.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>The separation of the Greeks from the southern Aryac
stream took place somewhere in the valley of the
Danube, whence a portion of the original Hellenes
moved down the Adriatic into the Morea, and other
bands known as Carians, Leleges, Phrygians, etc.,
passed into Asia Minor.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> Even the island of Cyprus,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
close to the Syrian shore, appears to have supported a
Greek population previous to its occupancy by the
Egyptians and Semitic peoples.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>The Greek language has strong affinities to the ancient
Persian and Sanscrit, showing conclusively that
the Aryac tribes whose descendants developed these
tongues dwelt in eastern Europe between the Slavonic
peoples on the north and the proto-Hellenes on the
south. At a later date, that is, about 1500 B. C., numerous
Phenician colonists occupied the shores of
Greece, constructing the so-called “Cyclopean” walls,
and leaving a lasting impression, both on the language
and culture of the Aryac population.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> Greek civilization
undoubtedly derived its early inspiration from
Semitic and Hamitic sources, and nearly thirty per
cent. of the Greek roots are non-Aryac, proving a
large admixture of foreign thought and blood at some
remote epoch.</p>

<p>The ancient Greek physical type was rather Slavonic
than Celtic. The skull was long (about 76), the forehead
high, the nose narrow and straight (the “Grecian
nose”), the face oval and orthognathic, the complexion
fair, the hair blonde or chestnut, and the eyes
blue or grey.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> The highest bodily symmetry of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
human species was reached among them, and its proportions
were perpetuated for all time in the noble
products of Greek plastic art.</p>

<p>The modern Greeks have undergone extensive commingling
with Slavonians, Turks, Bulgarians, etc., so
that the ancient type is no longer common, and the
population is generally darker in complexion, and the
skull more globular than in classic ages.</p>

<p>At a very remote epoch the Hellenic peoples occupied
southern Italy (Magna Grecia), Sicily, portions
of southern France and the regions on both shores of
the Hellespont, their easternmost colonies extending
quite into Syria. During the middle ages the establishment
of the capital of the eastern empire at Constantinople,
gave to Greek a position in the east equal
to that of Latin in the west. Crushed out, first by the
Romans and next by Mongolian hordes, within this
century the Hellenic peoples are rapidly regaining a
prominent position. Their settlements in Asia Minor
are displacing the Turks, and in all the cities of the
Levant they form one of the most active elements of
the population.</p>

<p>In certain mental endowments, the Hellenic peoples
won a position far ahead of all others. The sense of
artistic form was possessed by them in a superlative
degree; for the highest philosophic thought they
showed an aptitude unparalleled in the annals of the
race; in mathematics and mechanics, in poetry and the
drama, in architecture and in literature, they created
models of such perfection that the later generations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
of other nations have been content to do little more
than imitate them. To this day that culture which is
properly called the highest, must be based on a long
and loving study of Greek art and thought.</p>

<h4><i>5. The Lettic Peoples.</i></h4>

<p>The Letts and Lithuanians, dwelling on the shores
of the Baltic Sea, partly in Prussia and partly in
Russia, are unimportant peoples politically, and indeed
every way but ethnographically. In this respect, however,
they deserve particular attention, because in the
opinion of a number of modern writers they “have
the best claim to represent the primitive Aryac race.”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>
This claim is based on the structure of their language,
which seems to preserve characteristics of an exceedingly
primitive type, such for instance as a dual number,
numerous oblique cases, an archaic phonology;<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>
and also on their physical appearance, being tall
blondes, with blue eyes, and moderately long skulls
(about 78°). Both in appearance and language they
are a connecting link between the Slavonic and Teutonic
peoples. The westernmost dialect of the group,
the “old Prussian,” now extinct, was spoken west of
the Vistula, and perhaps extended to the coast of the
German Ocean. Their total number at present is not
over 2,000,000.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

<h4><i>6. The Teutonic Peoples</i></h4>

<p>Separated from the Letto-Slavonians about the beginning
of the Age of Bronze (see above p. 152), and extended
themselves toward central and southern Germany,
north into Scandinavia, and west along the
shores of the North Sea. Their most celebrated ancient
tribes were the Goths and Vandals, the Angles
and Saxons, the Danes and Norsemen, the Franks
and Alemanni, the Lombards and the Burgundians.
The modern nations which with more or less justice
are classed as of Teutonic descent, are the German
speaking population of the German and Austrian empires,
the States of Sweden and Norway, Denmark,
Holland, western Switzerland and England. It is
needless to say that there is little purity of descent in
most of these lands; the highest is believed to be in
Scandinavia. There we find still in the ascendant the
tall and muscular frame, the fair hair and complexion,
the blue eyes and full blonde beards which the Greek
and Roman writers agree in attributing to the dreaded
northern barbarians. The skull is long, the temperament
lymphatic, and the complete growth attained
later than in the Celtic stock.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>The mental character of the Teuton is somewhat
sluggish and material, but is directed by clear insight
and unconquerable pertinacity. His conquests,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
whether on the field of battle or in the arena of the
intellect, have been attained by deliberate calculation
and dogged obstinacy. His clear judgment refuses to
be controlled by the mere dicta of authority. In the
fourth century the Goths attached themselves to the
great Arian heresy, and a thousand years later their
descendants were the first to throw off the yoke of the
Roman church. The profoundest metaphysician of
modern times, Emmanuel Kant, was a Teuton; but
his avowed purpose was to prove the futility of all
metaphysical speculation. The poets and dramatists
of the Teutonic nations, Shakespeare, Schiller,
Goethe, were the first to break definitely with the classical
models, and vindicate the freedom of the artist.</p>

<p>Within the last century, the extension of this group
over the globe has left all others far behind. The
German, the Englishman and the Anglo-American
now control the politics of the world, and their contributions
to every department of literature, science
and the arts have been the main stimuli of the marvellous
progress of the nineteenth century.</p>

<h4><i>7. The Slavonic Peoples.</i></h4>

<p>In the early historic period there stretched a line of
kindred agricultural and nomadic tribes from the
Baltic to the Black and Caspian seas, forming the
northern outposts of the Aryac stock, in immediate
contiguity with the Mongolian race. They were the
Scythians, Sarmatians, Massagetes, etc. Their languages
belonged to what is called the Slavonic group,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
and had a marked family likeness; but the physical
traits of the various tribes were then, as now, very
various, and the most that can be said is that the majority
were blondes, with flaxen hair, full beards and
a tendency to dolichocephaly.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>These tribes were the ancestors of the numerous
Slavonic peoples of the present day, the Russians,
Ruthenians, Poles, the Wends in Prussia, the Czechs
of Bohemia, the Bulgarians and Servians, the Montenegrins,
Dalmatians and Croatians. All these, and
some smaller communities, speak to-day Slavic dialects,
though they are by no means all of pure Slavic
descent. There has been a constant intermingling
with the Mongolians, easily recognizable in physical
traits and mental character. Though early brought
into contact with civilization, the Slavonic peoples
have been the last of all the Aryans to appreciate its
greatest benefits. Within a century, however, their
progress has been phenomenal, and, except the English
people, no other nation within that period has
extended so widely the domain of enlightened governmental
control over half-savage tribes. The conquests
of the Russians in northern and central Asia
have always been attended with beneficent results for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
the conquered people, and nothing but the selfish jealousy
of other European governments has prevented
these conquests from being far more extensive and far
more fruitful of good to mankind.</p>

<p>The Russian is laborious, submissive, dreamy, unpractical.
The individual is lost in the community,
the <i>mir</i>, a communistic village association of great
antiquity. His religion is the merest formality, relieved
by outbreaks of fanaticism. Russian literature,
which has lately become the vogue in other nations, is
introspective and unhealthful, oriental in its spirit,
occidental in its cravings.</p>

<p>The ancient Slavonic tribes had close relations with
the Eranic peoples, the Medes and Persians. The
connecting link seems to have been the Sigyni and
Agathyrsi tribes, who dwelt south of the Carpathians,
in what is now Transylvania. Both of these claimed
relationship to the Medes, and when they were conquered
by the Celtic Dacians, many of them followed
their cousin in Asia. They were not without culture,
and Herodotus speaks of them as loving luxury, and
decorating themselves with gold. Ornaments of this
metal, worked with creditable skill, are found in their
graves, along with polished stone, implements and
fragments of pottery.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<h4><i>8. The Indo-Eranic Peoples.</i></h4>

<p>The colony of the Aryans which pushed its way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
furthest to the east was the Indo-Eranic. Its various
dialects prove conclusively that its ancestral tribe,
when on European soil, occupied a position between
the Slavonic and Hellenic peoples, probably between
the Danube and the Egean Sea. Its latest contingent,
the Armenian people, was a branch of the Thracian
Briges, and occupied their territory in Asia Minor
about 700 B. C. The main migration preceded them
at least two thousand years, and divided into two
branches, one establishing its chief power between the
Caspian Sea and the Indian Ocean, the other crossing
the Hindu-Kusch range and gradually obtaining the
chief control of Hindostan. The former includes the
Eranic, the latter the Indic groups of the Aryac stock.</p>

<p>The ancient representatives of the Eranic peoples
were the old Bastrians and Persians. In the language
of the former, sometimes called <i>Zend</i>, their sacred
book, the <i>Zend-avesta</i>, was written probably about 500
B. C., and in the latter many cuneiform inscriptions
are preserved, dating somewhat later.</p>

<p>Their modern descendants are the Persians and
Parsees, the tribes of Afghanistan, Beluchistan,
Kurdistan, and Luristan, and the Ossetes, who dwell
in the vales of the central Caucasus.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> Most of these
are Mohammedans in religion, and in a backward
condition of civilization. Their physical appearance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
speaks of frequent intermixtures with Mongolic and
Semitic elements.</p>

<p>The ordinary rural population of Persia are called
the Tadchiks. They are diligent agriculturists, and
devoted likewise to commercial pursuits. In the latter
capacity they are often met from Constantinople to
China. Their language is usually the modern Persian,
an Aryac dialect which has departed from the
original inflectional standard almost as much as the
modern English. Those who live in Kaschgar, however,
speak Turkish, while retaining the physical traits
of their Aryac ancestry.</p>

<p>Modern Persian has developed an interesting literature,
consisting chiefly of poetry and works of imagination.</p>

<p>The Afghans and Beluchis are the nearest related
to the Indian stock. Their dialects are derived from
the Sanscrit, and in appearance they resemble the
Indo-Aryans rather than the Persian. The assertion
of some ethnographers that they are of Semitic affinities
has been disproved. They are, however, mixed
with Semitic and Dravidian blood. Although historically
established about their present locality since the
days of Alexander the Great, they retain faint traditions
that their ancestors came from the west, which
has led some to suppose them of Syrian extraction.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>
In religion they are generally fanatical Mohammedans,
and their nationality is a loose federation of independent
clans.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>

<p>The Indic branch of this colony entered Hindostan
as late as 2000-1500 B. C. Its language was then as
closely akin to the Bactrian as, say, Italian and French
are to-day. Its members were roving herdsmen, and
first occupied the valleys of the Punjaub, driving before
them the Dravidas, a non-Aryac folk, who had
occupied the land. The priestly class of these colonists
were called Brahmans, their dialect Sanscrit, and
in this we have preserved from that remote epoch
many religious chants called the Rig Veda, committed
to writing probably about 500 B. C. The original
tongue soon split up into many dialects, as the Pali,
the Prakrit and the modern Hindoostantee.</p>

<p>The population of the Indian peninsula to-day, who
speak these dialects and are more or less of Aryac
blood, numbers nearly a hundred million. They include
the Rajpoots, the Djats, the Hindoos, the
Hunzas, and numerous other tribes and castes. The
ubiquitous gipsies or Romany are a wandering branch
of these who left India as late as the twelfth or thirteenth
century, and have been roving over Europe
ever since.</p>

<p>The earliest Indo-Aryans had undoubtedly retained
many pure Aryac traits. They were of medium
height, oval faces, handsome regular features, symmetrical
in body, the skull dolichocephalic (about 77),
the complexion brunette but not brown, the eyes hazel,
the hair wavy. This is the type of the highest Brahmans
to-day, and throughout all their history they
have exercised the utmost care to preserve it intact.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
The institution of castes was undoubtedly established
with this object in view, the word for “caste,” <i>varna</i>,
in Sanscrit meaning “color.”</p>

<p>The mental aptitudes of the Indic immigrants are
seen to advantage in their rapid conquest of Hindostan,
in the civilization they developed, and in the vast
literature which they created.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> While in art and philosophy
inferior to the Greeks, they succeeded in one
point far beyond any other Aryac people, that is, in
the formation of two of the most successful religions
of the world, Brahmanism and Buddhism. The former,
a pure pantheism, has been established nearly
4000 years, and still can claim votaries; the latter,
theoretically an atheism, to-day has more believers than
any other cult.</p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">The Caucasic Stock.</span></h3>

<p>The defiles and fastnesses of the Caucasus have been
time out of mind harbors of refuge for the defeated
tribes of the neighboring regions. Isolated in their
secluded homes, in ceaseless warfare with their neighbors,
an astonishing diversity of type and language
arose. When the Romans undertook to explore these
mountains, they had to call in the aid of seventy interpreters!
It is not surprising, therefore, that we find
communities there to-day, tribes apparently of Aryac
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
lineage, speaking agglutinative languages, and others,
of Mongolic appearance, quite unconnected with any
Mongolic tongue. Divided as far as possible by linguistic
resemblances, the Caucasian peoples may be
placed under four groups:</p>

<p>1. The Lesghic, which includes the Avars, and people
of Daghestan.</p>

<p>2. The Circassic, in which fall the Circasians
proper, and others.</p>

<p>3. The Kistic, and</p>

<p>4. The Georgic, the principal members of which are
the Georgians and Mingrelians.</p>

<p>The physical types vary greatly, but it is well
known that the brunette beauties of Georgia have long
been accounted among the handsomest women of the
race, and many of the men are remarkably noble in
feature. Intellectually, however, they have never
taken a high rank.</p>

<p>Of them all, the Georgian tribes have the oldest
culture, the traditions reaching as far back as 1200
B. C., and some trustworthy data as far as 700 B. C.
They were among the early converts to Christianity,
and about the beginning of this century voluntarily
accepted the sovereignty of Russia.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p>The Georgian girls have long been celebrated for
their beauty, and merit their renown; but they age
very rapidly. The Circassian women are also celebrated,
but are less perfect beauties. Both have black
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
eyes and dark hair, the complexion a brunette sometimes
to brownness. The Circassian girls were those
who principally supplied the harems of Constantinople.
They went willingly, and their families saw
nothing shameful in such a transaction.</p>

<p>Their traits and geographical location have gained
for the Caucasians the credit of being the oldest as
well as the purest type of the white race, which indeed
has been often called the “Caucasian” race.
Recent archæological researches, however, have shown
that the Caucasus was not inhabited until the close
of the neolithic period.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> An examination of the
geological condition of these mountains proves that
they were covered with glaciers until a late period,
especially on the southern slope, and no vestige of
human occupation previous to the neolithic period has
been found in this alleged cradle of the human race,
and pretended place of origin of some of our domestic
animals.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>

<p>We have seen that the African continent at the
period of its first occupancy was divided by the sea
(now desert) of the Sahara into two unequal portions,
the northern being properly an appendix of
Europe. The southern portion began at the Mediterranean
on the north, where the tertiary plateau of
Tripoli rises above the sea, included the valley of the
Nile above the Delta, and the remainder of the continent
as it now is, together with the island of Madagascar,
with which it was then connected by a land bridge.
As the Sahara sea evaporated to become a desert, its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
vast tracts and also the lower Nile valley and the
eastern coast nearly to the Equator were occupied by
the Hamitic stock of the white race. The remainder
of the continent was in the possession of the Austafrican
or black race.</p>

<p>This race is divisible into three quite different types
or branches, resembling each other in possessing a
very dark skin, black eyes, woolly hair, a prognathic
face, and generally a dolichocephalic skull, but differing
widely in many minor traits. These types are the
<i>Negrillos</i>, the <i>Negroes</i>, and the <i>Negroids</i>.</p>

<p>The general characteristics of the Austafrican
race are the most positively marked of any of the
varieties of our species, and as it is certainly the
lowest in zoölogical analogies, by some writers it has
been considered the oldest of all. This reasoning is
erroneous. The black race developed quite locally,
under the influence of intense heat and humidity. Its
original habitat must have been where alone its purest
representatives have always been permanently residing,
that is, on the lowlands of western central Africa,
between the equator and 12° north latitude, and from
lake Tchad to the Atlantic. The hot and moist depression
watered by the great river Niger, may be
named as the probable “area of characterization” of
the distinctive physical type of this race.</p>

<p>How far from this center was its maximum extension
has been variously estimated. There is no
evidence that the blacks ever occupied the lower Nile
valley, the area of ancient Egypt. On the oldest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
monuments they are represented as slaves, and the
Egyptian type discloses no sign of admixture with
Negro blood. They occupied at one time the southern
oases of the Sahara, but their dominion never
extended as far north as Fezzan. The presence of
Negro colonies and mixed breeds which is visible in
the northern oases, is owing to the importation of the
Soudanese as slaves, and also to the extensive migrations
they are still in the habit of making. I learned
when visiting some of these oases, that many black
families are constantly moving from one to another in
pursuit of their various callings.</p>

<p>It is an historical fact that from the beginning of
the Christian era at least, and probably much longer,
the whole of the southern Sahara and the northern
portion of the Niger valley have been under the absolute
control of the Berbers, members of the Eurafrican
race. They founded in those lands the extensive
monarchies of Ghanata and Melle, which maintained
their supremacy through many centuries.</p>

<p>On the east it is not likely that the Negroes ever
gained prolonged control east of the White Nile.
That portion of the continent between this river and
the Arabian gulf has been held by the same peoples
since the time the ancient Egyptians sent their trading
ships to “the land Punt,” the name under which they
knew it; and these peoples were not of the Austafrican
type or race.</p>

<p>The general tendency of migration in central as in
southern Africa, so far as it can be traced in historic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
times, has been westerly and southwesterly. The
densest population has been near the Atlantic coast,
as if the various tribes had been crowded to the impassable
barrier of the ocean.</p>

<p>Whether the basin of the Congo was ever held by
the true Negro race, is an undecided question. If so,
they were completely driven thence in proto-historic
times. South of that region they certainly never
penetrated, as the Hottentot and Bushman type cannot
be considered as a derivative from the true Negro,
but only as a descendant from a common ancestor,
unlike either, and is perhaps a much older member of
the family. Hence I shall begin the description of
the race with</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Negrillos.</span></h3>

<p>This diminutive form of the Spanish word <i>negro</i>,
black, is applied to an unusually small variety of the
race, which by several careful writers is believed to be
the oldest of all the African varieties, and at one time
to have occupied the most of the continent. Herodotus
and other classical authors speak of the Pygmies
of Ethiopia, and there is sufficient evidence to show
that in his day they dwelt in localities as far north as
the 18th degree of latitude.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>For a long time modern skepticism assigned these
statements to the realms of fable, but the rapid exploration
of Central Africa in this century proves their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
general correctness. Many travellers, especially Du
Chaillu, Schweinfurth, Stanley, and Emin Bey, have
seen and described these dwarfs, and a few of them
have been brought to Europe.</p>

<p>At present they are not found more than two degrees
north of the equator, whence they extend southward
into the territory of the Congo. Their various
tribes are known by different names, as Akkas, Tikkitikkis,
Batuas, Dokos, Obongos, Vouatouas, etc.</p>

<p>The height of the male is four feet six to eight
inches, the body is symmetrical and remarkably agile,
the facial angle is exceedingly low (about 60°-65°),
the face markedly prognathic, the chin retreating, the
lips protruding, and the ears large and ugly. The
color is not black, but a dark reddish brown, and the
skull has a tendency to a globular form. The nose is
flat (about 55°), and there is a strong odor to the skin.
The hair is woolly, and in tufts, and the body is
covered with coarse short hairs, “so that the surface
feels like a piece of felt.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p>These extraordinary people have no settled abodes,
build no towns, cultivate nothing. They depend entirely
on hunting and fishing, and the barter of the
products of the chase to agricultural tribes. They are
skilful in the use of the bow, employing small poisoned
arrows, and also manufacture spears. Voracious
cannibals and unerring marksmen, they are looked on
with dread by the negroes around them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>Of their religion we have no knowledge further
than that they have an extreme dread of strange objects,
lest some malignant influence lurk in them.</p>

<p>In the south of Africa we find another group of
tribes, the Bushmen and Hottentots, also of small
stature, and in many respects resembling the Akkas.
They are equally far removed from the true negroes,
and it is the opinion of some very competent observers,
notably the German travelers, Schweinfurth and
Fritsch, that all these dwarf tribes belong to the same
stock.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> The objection to this chiefly is that the Bushmen
are often dolichocephalic, but so also are some
of the Akkas, and at any rate this consideration is not
alone of sufficient weight to be decisive. There is
little doubt but that this dwarf stock extended over
Madagascar, where they were known as Quimos or
Kimos, and are believed still to exist in the southern
part of the island.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>The Bushmen are much better known than the
Akkas. They dwell in and around the great Kalihari
desert, usually in a half-famished condition, and on
the lowest social scale. They are wandering hunters,
making use of the bow and arrow, and are not cannibals.</p>

<p>The Hottentots are a mixture of the Bushmen and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
the Negroid-Bantu tribes in their vicinity. They are
taller than the Bushmen, better nourished, and lead a
pastoral life, possessing herds of cows and fixed habitations.
Their language is remarkable for the number
of its “inspirates,” or “click” sounds, to form which
one must draw in the breath, similar to some we use
in urging horses. In form it is agglutinative. In
these respects and in others, it resembles the dialects
of the Bushmen, and those who are competent to speak
on the subject believe that both can be traced to a
common source.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p>The Hottentot is rather a hopeless case for civilizing
efforts. He hates profoundly work, either physical
or mental, and is passionately fond of rum and tobacco,
or failing the latter, he will stupefy himself by smoking
the wild hemp. He is too indolent to attempt
agriculture, and is content to live on milk, raw roots,
and the product of the chase.</p>

<p>Some of the English travellers, on the other hand,
say the Hottentots have as much wit as their neighbors,
the Dutch boors! Certain it is that before they
were oppressed by the whites, they possessed herds
of cows, goats and sheep, dressed hides, dug wells,
manufactured pottery, in some places tilled the ground
and built fixed villages or kraals.</p>

<p>The oft-repeated assertion that they are destitute of
religion is, like all such, utterly false. On the contrary,
they have quite a developed mythology, perform
rites and say prayers. Their principal deity is Tsunigoam,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
to whom they appeal as “the father of all
things” and “our master.” At the rise of certain stars
they hold festivals in honor of the gods of light, and
they believe the spirits of the dead wander about and
should be placated.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> Their cult, indeed, compares
favorably with that of classic Greece.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Negroes.</span></h3>

<p>The true Negroes of Africa are confined to what
the Arabs call <i>Beled es Sudan</i>, the Land of the Blacks,
the Sudan, and adjacent parts. It is therefore an
error to look on that continent as mainly inhabited by
negroes. At least a third of it has always been principally
peopled by the whites, and another third by
tribes not of pure negro stock. The true negro type,
such as I have described it in my first lecture (see
page 48), is scarcely seen in resident tribes south of
the Equator or north of the tropic of Cancer. Within
that limit they may be divided for purposes of study
into four groups, the Nilotic, the Sudanese, the Senegambian
and the Guinean.</p>

<h4><i>1. The Nilotic Group.</i></h4>

<p>These begin with the Changallas, east of Sennaar,
in the Egyptian Sudan, between the 10th and 15th
degree of north latitude. To the south of them
along the White Nile are the Dinkas, the Chilluks,
the Nuers, Kiks, Baris, and other tribes. These are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
wholly black and in a rudimentary stage of culture,
depending chiefly on hunting and fishing. They go
naked, the women at most wearing little aprons.
Some of them are cannibals, and all are of savage
dispositions. As a rule they are tall and powerful,
and brave in war.</p>

<p>The Nuers are spoken of as of fine physical traits,
and building handsome and durable houses. Their
bows and arrows, and the helmets of their warriors,
resemble those depicted on ancient Egyptian monuments.
It is probable that they are of mixed blood,
their hair being less woolly than that of their neighbors.
The Baris, who live on the White Nile, are described
as an intelligent people. They cultivate millet
and tobacco, understand the reduction of iron and
copper from the ores found in their country, and are
skilful merchants, making long voyages to exchange
their wares.</p>

<h4><i>2. The Sudanese Group.</i></h4>

<p>The Central Sudan is the site of the most important
negro states, the monarchies of Bornu, Bagirmi and
Wadai. The two former are in the fruitful depressions
which surround Lake Tchad, a large fresh water sea
in the center of one of the most delightful tropical
basins in the world. The natives are known as Kanoris,
Kanembus, Marghis, Haussas, Biddumas, etc.
They are true negroes, very black, and of strong body.</p>

<p>Further to the west commences the watershed of
the Niger, the great river of Central Africa, describing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
in its course a vast semicircle more than two thousand
miles in length. On its banks are numerous
kingdoms and some cities of magnitude, as Sansandig,
with 30,000 inhabitants, and the better known Timbuctoo,
with 20,000. Many of their houses are built
of sun-dried bricks, and an active commerce is carried
on. But it must be added that these houses and this
commerce have been created by the Arabs, Tauregs,
and mixed races, not by the negroes themselves.
These are principally tillers of the soil, hunters, fishers
and warriors. They nominally govern the states of
Gando, Sokoto, Fellata and others, but Arab influence
is visible everywhere, and the beneficent results of the
introduction of the Mahommedan religion in this part
of Africa is strongly attested even by English travellers.</p>

<p>The Haussas, the Todas, and the Tibbus, tribes
near the border of the desert, are principally of negro
blood, but with a visible strain of Hamitic descent in
them. The last mentioned, indeed, should properly be
classed with the Berber stock.</p>

<h4><i>3. The Senegambian Group.</i></h4>

<p>The country south of the Senegal river to the coast
of Sierra Leone is known as Senegambia, or the western
Sudan. It is claimed by the French, who own
the shadow of a sway there. The tribes near the coast
are the Sereres, the Wolofs, the Baniuns, and many
others, all in a low stage of culture. To the east is
the important nation of the Mandingoes, occupying an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
extensive territory adjoining western Guinea on the
south, and stretching east to the heights near Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>The Wolofs present a pure type of the Negro race,
perfectly homogeneous, and, according to Dr. Tautain,
it is impossible to find among them a single physical
character hinting at an admixture of any other
blood. Their faces are prognathic, and the women
have the projecting gluteal region, so marked a trait
in the Austafrican. Their language is agglutinative,
and is an independent stock. Most of the Wolofs are
Mohammedans, and in social organization they maintain
a rigid system of castes, based principally on occupation.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p>The principal divisions of the Mande or Mandingo
nation are the Mallinki, the Soninki, and the Bambaras.
They are not so pure in blood as the Wolofs, many
among them having regular features, light complexions,
and straighter hair. These traits are doubtless
owing to their long contact with the Arabs and the
Berbers, the latter of whom have controlled their
country more or less for two thousand years. They
are active in commerce, and cultivate the soil, the
men working with the women in the fields.</p>

<h4><i>4. The Guinean Group.</i></h4>

<p>Most of the tribes of the coast of Guinea are in a
condition of savagery, and have deteriorated by their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
contact with the whites. The petty kingdoms of
Ashanti, Fanti, and Dahomey are heard of from time
to time in our newspapers as the scene of some particularly
bloody rite or massacre. For generations this
was the central point of the slave trade, and the encouragement
it gave to devastating wars led to the
destruction of all progress. It is here, on what is
called the Pepper Coast, that we established the Republic
of Liberia, where about 20,000 negroes from
the United States are carrying out a moderately successful
experiment of returning to their native continent.</p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">The Negroids.</span></h3>

<p>A large portion of the African continent is occupied
by tribes of dark hue, but lacking some of the
most prominent traits of the true negro. These are
the “Negroids,” who are probably the products of a
long and close fusion of the Negro with the Hamitic
and Semitic types. Their color is not black, but a
dark, reddish, coppery brown; the hair is crisp and
frizzly, but not woolly; the nose is straight and better
formed than that of the negro; the lips are thick, the
skull long, and the peculiar odor of the negro is
absent.</p>

<p>We find these traits in two groups, both of which
unquestionably had their historic origin along the
Nile, above the first cataract, and in the region
drained by its tributaries&mdash;in other words, the locality
where for ten thousand years or more the Hamites
and the Negroes have been in constant contact.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

<p>We can only speculate on the numberless wars and
marriages, on the extensive slave trade and commercial
intercourse which throughout this period have
blended the races into so many intermediate types
that it becomes impossible in many cases to say with
which a given tribe should be classified. To add to
the confusion, a large Semitic element was added at
two epochs, one when the Abyssinian branch of the
Semites moved across from Arabia to occupy Abyssinia,
the other when, under the impulsion of the fanaticism
of Islam, the Arabs followed up the Nile in
their proselyting campaigns.</p>

<p>The latter event began in the seventh century of
our era and has continued ever since. The former
probably began in earnest in the height of the power
of the Himyaritic states of southern Arabia, which we
may roughly put at seven centuries before Christ. A
century or two later than this, negro tribes from the
Sudan overran the decaying cities of the upper Nile
and established a temporary control along its banks;
and the emperor Diocletian induced many of them to
settle as far north as Assuan.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> These various influences
combined to produce the numerous mixed types
which one sees along the Nile, rendering its ethnography
peculiarly obscure.</p>

<p>Under the pressure of increasing population and
external inroads, these mixed peoples divided into two
groups, one, the Nubian, remaining in the original
district, the other, the Bantu, removing to the south
and southwest.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span></p>

<h4><i>1. The Nubian Group</i></h4>

<p>Includes the Nubas proper, who are partly a mixed
people, while some of them are pure negroes from
Kordofan; the Barabras, who dwell on both sides of
the Nile between the first and second cataracts; the
Fundjas and Bertas, further south; and the Monbuttus
and Nyam Nyams, or Sandehs, near Lake Victoria
Nyanza, besides many tribes of less note. Most of
them are more or less agricultural, and live in small
villages. Their clothing is very slight, and many
tattoo the skin. The Sandeh and Monbuttu are cannibals,
and even eat those who die of disease. Nevertheless,
they have a knowledge of metals, and are
skilful iron-smiths.</p>

<p>The physical appearance of most of these tribes
differs equally from the Arab and the negro. They
are generally of medium stature with thin limbs and
flat feet. The hair is crisp, but not woolly, and the
color varies from a black to a white brown. The beard
is meagre and the skin hairless. The features are not
of the negro cast, but assimilate rather those of the
European.</p>

<p>Most of them are agriculturists in a small way.
They raise the “caffre corn” and millet, and make
some efforts to irrigate their fields where it is necessary.
Their dwellings are wretched huts, and their
arts are of the rudest.</p>

<p>Not many centuries ago there was a large number
of so-called Christians among them, but their religion
seems to have left little impression on their character.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<p>At present they are professedly Mohammedans, but
really either fetichists or indifferent. Their morals
are not well-spoken of, though it is also said that the
class with whom travellers usually come into contact
are not favorable specimens of the population&mdash;as is
apt to be the case everywhere.</p>

<p>The Puls, or Fellahs, and the Fans, who live to the
west in the Sudan, removed to the regions they now
occupy from the Nile valley, and belong to the Negroid
type. They have made extensive conquests in
the vast unexplored country between Timbuctoo and
the equator. Abstaining from alcohol and tobacco,
condemning music and dancing, and blindly adhering
to the precepts of the Koran, they are unpopular
among their negro neighbors, but have brought many
of them under subjection. Their occupations are both
pastoral and agricultural, while as commercial travellers,
and wandering smiths, they roam from one end
of the Sudan to the other. They weave cotton cloth,
tan and dye leather, and work it into various articles
of use which are widely celebrated for their excellence,
and in times past were among the most extensive
slave dealers of Central Africa.</p>

<p>The languages of this group belong to four diverse
linguistic stocks, all of the agglutinative character. It
has been called the equatorial family of central Africa.
They are usually agreeable to the ear, the verbs are
simple, and the syntax not complicated.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<h4><i>2. The Bantu Group</i></h4>

<p>Occupies nearly the whole of Africa south of the
equator, except the territory of the Bushmen and
Hottentots. It includes the Suahelis, the Mazimbas
and the Caffres on the east coast, the Sakalavas of
Madagascar, the Bechuanas west of the Caffres, the
Zulus, and nearly all the numerous tribes of the
Congo basin, the Angola and Zambesi rivers.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>Their ancestors at one period resided to the northeast,
probably somewhere in Ethiopia, where a prolonged
fusion of Hamitic blood with the genuine
Negro produced their physical type. They are usually
tall and well built, the color is a dark coppery
brown, the head is long (74), the hair is frizzly, and
the nose rather straight.</p>

<p>All the Caffre people are pastoral in habits, and
have large herds of cows. Agriculture is practised
on a limited scale. Their temperament is turbulent
and warlike, and many of them are cannibals. Their
social organization is military, but slavery is unusual.
Singular to say, they do not know the bow and arrow,
their weapons being the war-club and a lance called an
<i>assegai</i>. Their religion is a fetichism, and polygamy
is universal. On the whole, they are on a higher
level of culture than the Negroes of the Sudan. All
the Bantu tribes are mono-glottic, that is, they speak
dialects traceable to one original stem. These have a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
peculiar alliteration, and form their words by means
of prefixes of elements placed before the root, this
being their special method of agglutination. It is divided
into three principal dialects, and is the most
widely extended of any of the African linguistic stocks,
except the Libyan.</p>

<p>The vast basin of the Congo river, including over
two million square miles, is now mostly included in
the “Congo Independent State.” Its native inhabitants
are connected by language with the Negroids of
the Bantu group, and several of them retain traditions
of their immigration into the districts they now inhabit.
The Waganda, for instance, report that their ancestors
came from the northeast, the Watuta and Masiti from
near the Zambesi river. Many of them are of a light,
bright brown, and are devoid of the peculiar odor
of the true negro. All the tribes from Lake Tanganyika
to the Atlantic speak dialects manifestly
akin.</p>

<p>They are divided into independent nations, some of
large extent, and are subject to chiefs, who rule with
despotic power. Their religion is fetichistic, and
though they generally are agricultural, and possess a
certain degree of culture, cannibalism is or was frequent
among them. Slavery also existed in some of
its most deplorable forms, and up to a very recent
date, if not still, there was a regular trade in young
slaves to be fattened, killed and eaten on certain solemn
occasions.</p>

<p><i>General Observations on the Race.</i>&mdash;Although the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
true Negroes occupied but a small portion of the African
continent, the infusion of their blood into their
Hamitic and Semitic neighbors, resulting in the Negroid
type, was to such a degree that these mixed
stocks became assimilated in character much more to
the black than to the white race, and were brought approximately
to the mental level of the former.</p>

<p>Neither the Negroes nor the Negroids ever carried
out a conquest of lands occupied by the Hamites or
Semites. We have vague histories of bloody wars on
a large scale among themselves, and the erection of
apparently powerful monarchies, but which soon fell
to pieces.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>The low intellectual position of the Austafrican race
is revealed by the facts that in no part of the continent
did its members devise the erection of walls of stone;
that they domesticated no animal, and developed no
important food-plant; that their religions never rose
above fetichism, their governments above despotism,
their marriage relations above polygamy. It is true
that many of them practise agriculture and the pastoral
life, but it is significant that the plants which they
especially cultivate, the “durra” or sorghum, millet,
rice, yams, manioc, and tobacco, were introduced from
Asia, Europe or America.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Their cattle and sheep are
descended from the ancient stocks domesticated by the
Egyptians, and differ from those represented on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
early monuments of Assyria and India. The brick-built
cities of the Sudan were constructed under Arab
influence, and the ruins of stone towers and walls in
the gold-bearing districts of South Africa show clear
traces of Semitic workmanship.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> The knowledge of
smelting and forging iron is of ancient date throughout
Africa, and they can temper steel with skill, but
the art of the smith is regarded as degrading, and
their long acquaintance with this most useful of metals
has not lifted them from a condition of barbarism.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>In many of the useful arts they reveal considerable
skill. The weaving of grass into mats and cloth, the
tanning and working of leather, the preparation of salt
and soap, dyeing and pottery, are occupations which
are wide spread. The true negroes are passionately
fond of music, singing and dancing, and the invention
of one instrument, the marimba, which is played by
beating wooden keys with a stick, is attributed to them.</p>

<p>The tendency of the negro race in Africa is that
which we observe among negro children in the public
schools of the United States. Their powers develop
quite as rapidly as those of white children up to a certain
point, up to the age of thirteen or fourteen; but
then there comes a diminution, often a cessation, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
their mental development. The physical overslaughs
the psychical, and they turn away from the pursuit of
culture. They are unwilling to undertake, they are
unequal to, the more arduous intellectual tasks.</p>

<p>I have already remarked that the Austafricans never
of their own volition made any serious inroad into the
territory of the white race. Yet there are to-day probably
more than twenty millions of them, including the
mulattoes, living among the whites, seven millions of
whom are in the United States. This extraordinary
condition is the result of the enormous deportation of
the blacks as slaves, which has been going on for thousands
of years.</p>

<p>The origin of the negroes in the United States may
be traced partly by the physical appearance, partly by
the few words of their mother tongues which have
survived the acquisition by them of the English language.
These words are generally connected with
the Mande stem of tongues spoken by the Mandingoes
and their neighbors, whom I have already referred to
as dwelling in Senegambia and the Western Sudan.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>
They were a nation of some importance, and having
early become in great part adherents of the Mohammedan
faith, established the monarchy of Melli, which
in the thirteenth century extended from Timbuctoo
to the coast, and forced many of the subjected tribes
to learn the Mande tongue.

<p>If you observe the relief of the continent of Asia,
you will note that from the lofty plateau of Pamir,
called by the orientals “The Roof of the World,” two
tremendous mountain chains diverge, the one to the
northeast, finally reaching the sea of Ochotsk, the
other to the southeast, meeting the southern ocean on
the west of the bay of Bengal. The region between
them is one of high and arid table lands, intersected
by mountain ranges, and giving birth to streams
which flow in circuitous courses to the eastern sea.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
Along the coast the land sinks to alluvial plains, and
north of this triangle, the endless forests, steppes, and
“tundras” of Siberia and Turkestan continue to the
Arctic sea.</p>

<p>The region thus described is the continent of Asia
in the proper geological and zoölogical sense; the valleys
of the Oxus, of Mesopotamia, and the land to the
west of them, properly belong to Europe, and in fact,
are included by naturalists in that continent, under the
name “Eurasia.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>Asia proper is thus divided into two contrasted
geographical areas, that of the table-lands and mountains
on the south, and that of the plains on the north.
These features have been decisive in directing the migrations
of its inhabitants, and to some extent in modifying
their traits. The vast majority, however, are
distinctly recognizable members of one race, which
has been variously termed the Asiatic, the Mongolian,
or the Yellow race.</p>

<p><i>Physical Traits of the Asian Race.</i>&mdash;As the last
mentioned adjective intimates, the prevailing color is
yellowish, tending in different regions toward a brown
or white, but never reaching the clear white of the
western European. The hair is straight, coarse and
black, abundant on the head, scanty on the face, almost
absent on the body. The stature is medium or
undersized, the legs thin, and the muscular power inferior
to that of the Eurafrican race. The skull has a
tendency to the globular form (meso- or brachycephalic),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
the face is round, the cheek bones prominent,
the nose flat at the bridge and depressed at the extremity,
the eyes are small and black, and the lids do
not open fully at the inner angle, giving the peculiar
appearance known as the oblique or Mongolian eye.
This last trait is not uncommon in the children of
Europeans, but it is generally outgrown. It is in the
adult an arrest of muscular development, although in
some instances it seems related to the bony confirmation
of the orbit.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="map_196" src="images/map_196.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Ethnic Chart of Eurasia and Asia.</span></p></div>

<p><i>Subdivisions.</i>&mdash;These are the general traits of the
Asian race, recurring more or less prominently
wherever its members of pure descent are found. It
is divisible, however, into two branches, corresponding
roughly with the two geographical divisions of the
continent to which I have alluded. The first of these
branches I call the Sinitic, from the old Greek form
of the word China, the other the Sibiric, an adjective
from the proper orthography of the name Siberia
(Sibiria). These branches are contrasted not only
in geographical location, but quite as much so in
language. The Sinitic peoples speak isolating, tonic,
monosyllabic languages, while the tongues of the Sibiric
population are polysyllabic and agglutinative.</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Sinitic Branch.</span></h3>

<p>This branch includes the people of the Chinese empire
and Farther India. They are separable into three
groups:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>1. The Chinese proper;</p>

<p>2. The Thibetans; and</p>

<p>3. The Indo-Chinese of Siam, Anam, Burmah, and
Cochin China.</p>

<p>The languages of all these have peculiar features
and such affinities that they all point to one ancestral
stock.</p>

<h4><i>1. The Chinese.</i></h4>

<p>The population of China as we know it at present is
the result of a fusion of a number of tribes of connected
lineage. Those who claim the purest blood
relate that somewhere about five thousand years ago
their ancestors came from the vicinity of the Kuen-lun
mountains, east of the Plateau of Pamir, and following
the head waters of the Hoang-ho and Yang-tse-Kiang
entered the northwestern province of China,
Shen-si. Here they found a savage people, the Lolo
and the Miaotse, whom they subjected or drove out,
and pursuing the river valleys, reached the fertile lowlands
along the coast. Their authentic annals begin
about 2350 B. C. Even then they had attained a respectable
stage of civilization, being a stable population,
devoted to agriculture, acquainted with bronze,
possessing domestic animals, and constructors of cities.
The hoariest traditions speak of the cultivation of the
“six field fruits,” which were three kinds of millet,
barley, rice, and beans. The sorghum, wheat, and
oats now common in parts of China are of comparatively
recent introduction.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<p>It is interesting to inquire whether these ancient arts
possessed by the Chinese were self-developed, or were
borrowed in part from the Eurafrican peoples of Iran
or Mesopotamia. The former opinion is that defended
by Peschel and some other ethnographers. They
claim that the culture of the Chinese was developed
independently in the secluded and fertile valleys of
their great rivers, and owed nothing to the evolution
of other civilizations until commerce and travel
brought them together within historic times. The individual
character of Chinese ancient culture speaks
strongly for this view; certainly the Chinese system of
writing is one based entirely on their range and
method of thought; their domestic animals are of varieties
formerly unknown in western Asia; and the
growth of many undoubted local industries, silk for
instance, for which they were celebrated in the days of
the prophet Ezekiel, prove an ancient capacity for self-development
not inferior to the Eurafrican race.</p>

<p>On the other hand, their astronomical system, which
was in use 2300 B. C., is practically identical with that
of the Arabs and Indo-Aryans, and points for its origin
to the Chaldees of Babylonia. In later days, that
is, since the beginning of our era, undoubtedly much
that has been looked upon as the outcrop of Chinese
culture is due to the Indo-Aryans. My own conclusion
is that in all important elements the ancient Chinese
civilization was a home product, a spontaneous
growth of an intellectually gifted people, but one
whose capacity of development was limited, and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
later generations were satisfied to borrow and appropriate
from the nations with whom commerce brought
them into contact.</p>

<p>This insufficiency of development is the weak point
of Chinese character, and is strikingly illustrated by
the little use they made of important discoveries.
They were acquainted as early as 121 A. D. with the
power of the magnet to point to the north; but the
needle was never used in navigation, but only as a toy.
They manufactured powder long before the Europeans,
but only to put it in fire-crackers. They invented
printing with movable type in the eleventh
century, but never adopted it in their printing offices.
They have domesticated cattle for thousands of years,
but do not milk the cows nor make butter. Paper
money has been in circulation for centuries, but the
scales and weight still decide the value of gold and
silver, coins of these precious metals being unknown.
Their technical skill in the arts is astonishing, but the
inspiration of the beautiful is wholly absent.</p>

<p>These historic facts disclose the psychical elements
of Chinese character. Its fundamental traits are sobriety,
industry, common sense, practicality. The
Chinaman regards solely what is visibly useful, materially
beneficial. His arts and sciences, his poems and
dramas, his religions and philosophies, all revolve
around the needs and pleasures of his daily life.
Such terms as altruism, the ideal, the universal, have
for him no sort of meaning, and an explanation of
them he would look upon as we do on the emptiest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
subtleties of the schoolmen&mdash;a <i>chimera bombinans in
vacuo</i>. Such an action as the martyr dying to atone
for the sins of others he could understand only as the
action of a deranged mind.</p>

<p>Their mental character is well shown in their religions.
Originally, the Chinese combined a simple
worship of the powers of nature with that of the spirits
of their ancestors. The principal deity was Tien, the
Heaven or Sky, in union with whom was the Earth,
and from this union all nature proceeded. This natural
and sexual dualism extended through all things.
The affairs of life are governed by countless demons
and spirits, whose tempers should be propitiated by
offerings and prayers. Days and seasons are auspicious
or the reverse, and most of the rites at present
in use are divinatory rather than devotional.</p>

<p>The Buddhist religion was introduced into China
about two centuries before Christ, and was officially recognized
as a state cult by the Emperor Ming-ti in
the year 65 A. D. Its spirit is, however, quite different
from the Buddhism of Ceylon, as it has degenerated
into a polytheism, a worship of the Bodhisattvas,
or saints who have reached the highest stage of perfection,
and might enter Nirvana, but do not, out of compassion
for men. In general, it may be said that the philosophical
and moral principles taught in the Buddhistic
classics are not known and would not be admitted
as representing their faith by Chinese Buddhists.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<p>The teachings of the celebrated philosopher, Confucius
(Con-fu-tse), which are a substitute for religion
among the most intelligent Chinese, are in reality
wholly agnostic. He declined to express himself on
any question relating to the gods or the possible after
life of the soul, asserting that the practical interests of
this life and the duties of a man to his family and the
state are numerous enough and clear enough to occupy
one’s whole time. When asked for some model or
code of such duties, he replied by the sententious expression
“When you are chopping out an axe-handle,
the model is near you,” meaning that it is in the hand,
and that in a similar manner in practical life we always
have the rule of right action in our own mind, if
we choose to look for it.</p>

<p>The second great philosopher of China was Lao-tse,
who lived in the generation following Confucius
(about 500 B. C.). His doctrine was pantheistic and
obscure, and his writings are considered the most difficult
to decipher of all the old Chinese classics. Nor
can his doctrine be called a religion. It was rather a
mystical speculation on the universe. All-Being, he
taught, is born of Not-Being, and existence, therefore,
is an illusion.</p>

<p>Practically, all religions are looked upon as equally
true. The Confucian will frequent the Buddhist temples,
and the Buddhist priest will perform rites in the
“house of reason,” as the Confucian holy place is
termed; or he will distribute tracts for the Christian
missionaries. The government is absolutely neutral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
in all religious questions, and the persecutions which
have been carried on against the Christian missionaries
have not been the promptings of fanaticism, but
dislike of foreigners and suspicion of their intentions.
The official documents of the Chinese government
speak with equal contempt of every form of religion,
and the rulers would never dream of interfering in any
such question.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<p>Many of the Chinese are Mohammedans, Islam having
been introduced by sea and land within the first
century of the Hegira. The Chinese converts learn
to repeat the Koran in Arabic, as it has not been translated
into their tongue; but few understand much of
it. Their rites and doctrines are learned by the verbal
instruction of their religious teachers. The Chinese
Mohammedans, however, recognize as their chief
ruler the Khalif or Sultan, and not the Emperor at
Pekin, and hence the bloody revolutions which have
from time to time broken out among them.</p>

<p>Christianity was introduced by the Nestorians in the
eighth century, and now may be freely taught in any
part of the realm. It has, however, had little success.
There are perhaps half a million Roman Catholic and
Protestant members. They belong to the lowest
classes, and can occupy no official position, owing to
the conflict of their dogmas with the teachings of Confucius
and the agnostic principles of the government.</p>

<p>Within the last generation or two the Chinese have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
displayed an unwonted desire for emigration. They
have swept down in hundreds of thousands on the
islands of Malasia, Australia, the Sandwich Islands,
Mexico, and the United States. We have as a nation
felt so impotent before them that, in open contradiction
to the principles of our government we have closed
our ports to them, and warned them from our shores.
This feeble and ignoble policy is a disgrace to us.
Far better to admit them, and to train earnest men
among us in the Chinese language and customs, so that
these foreigners could be brought to a knowledge of
the superiority of our religions and institutions, and
thus be united with us in the advancement of mankind.</p>

<h4><i>2. The Thibetan Group.</i></h4>

<p>The mountain-ringed land of Thibet is an arid
region from 10,000 to 20,000 feet in height, thickly
inhabited by a people whose principal interests in life
are religious. It is the centre of northern Buddhism,
and at the holy city of Lhasa the living incarnation of
the founder of that cult is supposed to live. In the
numerous monasteries, some on almost inaccessible
mountain sides, tens of thousands of monks pass their
lives in religious exercises. They are vowed to celibacy,
and throughout the land it is looked upon as a
distinct degradation to marry. The natural result is
that the relations of the sexes are relaxed, and their
morals debased. Polygamy is not uncommon, and in
Thibet, more than anywhere else, we find the peculiar
institution of polyandry, where a woman has two,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
three or four recognized husbands. It is usual for
several brothers thus to have the same wife.</p>

<p>The women are small but well made, and exercise
an unusual control in the affairs of life. The physical
traits of both sexes are Mongolian, though the eyes
are rarely oblique. The culture is rather low, the
Thibetan not being an ardent agriculturist, but preferring
the pastoral life. He milks his cows and makes
butter, which with hides and fleece, leather and some
local fabrics, are his principal articles of trade.</p>

<p>In the Himalayan valleys to the south are several
nations in which the Asian blood dominates, such as
the Ladakis of Cashmere, the Nepalese, the inhabitants
of Bhotan and numerous others. They are generally
mixed with Dravidian or Aryac blood, but
speak dialects of the Sinitic type.</p>

<h4><i>3. The Indo-Chinese Group.</i></h4>

<p>The regions we call Farther India and Cochin China
are at present inhabited by peoples speaking tonic,
monosyllabic languages, who are, however, generally
of mixed descent. Some of them have crimpled hair
and a dark complexion, suggesting the presence of
some Nigritic blood; others have features more Aryac
than Mongolian, hinting at an ancient fusion of Hindoostanee
strains. These form the modern nations of
Birma, Siam, Annam, Cambodia, Tonkin, and Cochin
China.</p>

<p>The Birmans have a well marked round head
(about 83°), oblique eyes, prominent cheek bones, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
are of medium stature and sturdy. Their color is a
brownish yellow or olive. In religion they are Buddhists,
but they are by no means celebrated for honesty
and morality. By a curious freak of fashion, the dress
of the women is open in front, but it is the height of
immodesty to show the naked foot.</p>

<p>The Siamese call themselves “Thai,” under which
designation come also the Laos. They are a mild
mannered people, without much energy, but willing to
be taught.</p>

<p>The Annamese and Tonkinese are somewhat superior
in culture to their neighbors, and of well
marked Asiatic physiognomy. The Cambodians, called
Khmers, are a mixed people, descended partly from
Mongolian ancestry, partly from Dravidian and Aryac
conquerors who occupied their country about the third
century, and left behind remarkable vestiges of their
presence in ruins of vast temples and stone-built palaces.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Sibiric Branch.</span></h3>

<p>The branch of the Asian race which I have called
the Sibiric, as geographically designating its pre-historic
home, has also been called the Turanian, the
Ural-Altaic, the Finno-Ugric, the Mongolic, etc. Its
geographical location is north of the Altai range, and
the Caspian and Black seas, and from the Pacific to
the Atlantic ocean. The languages of all its members
are polysyllabic and agglutinative, contrasting as
much with the Sinitic stock on the one hand as with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
the Aryac on the other. In physical appearance individuals
of reasonably pure descent present good
specimens of the Asian type, the skull brachycephalic,
the face round, the nose flat at the root, the eye small
and black, the hair straight and coarse, the color yellowish.
They are divided into many tribes, most of
whom were until recently addicted to a wandering
pastoral life, and though on the lower levels of culture
and without coherent social bonds, they have at times
loomed up as the most powerful and pretentious figures
in the history of the world.</p>

<p>Furthest to the east is</p>

<h4><i>1. The Tungusic Group</i>,</h4>

<p>Which occupies the coast from the northern boundary
of China to Kamschatka, and westward to the Yenissei
river. It embraces the Manchus and the Tungus.
The former, a bold hardy people, possessed
themselves of the throne of China early in the seventeenth
century, and continue to rule it by a military
despotism, adapted with consummate skill to the peculiarities
of Chinese character. This has led to an
extensive fusion of Sinitic blood among the Manchus,
and also an improvement in their social status. They
have become Buddhists, and their language is losing
ground before the Chinese.</p>

<p>The Tungus to the north of them, inhabiting a
vast district of forest, swamp and mountain, east of
the Yenissei river, are of ruder life. They depend
for subsistence on the chase and on their large herds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
of reindeer. In religion they adhere to the worship
of the powers of nature, and are under the control of
their priests or “shamans.” They present a well
marked Asiatic type, a brachycephalic skull (81°),
round face and oblique eyes, the hair coarse and
straight, the beard scanty. In stature they are of
medium height, strongly built, and the senses of sight
and hearing unusually keen.</p>

<p>Like most nations dwelling in or near the Arctic
zone, the disposition of the Tungus is decidedly cheerful
and affable. He is hospitable to strangers, and
honorable in his dealings. In habits, however, he has
no notion of cleanliness, and the Tatar name applied
to him&mdash;<i>tongus</i>, hog&mdash;expresses what his not over-nice
neighbors think of his mode of life.</p>

<p>The tribes were subjected to the Russian domination
about 1650, and have been gradually improving
their condition. A portion of them called Lamuts
reside on the sea of Ochotsk, and have fixed villages
with houses built in the Russian style.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<h4><i>2. The Mongolic Group</i></h4>

<p>had their original home in Mongolia, a vast arid country
south of the Altai range, and west of Manchuria.
Before the Christian era they had extended north beyond
the mountains and occupied the land around
Lake Baikal, whence they proceeded easterly, and under
the name of Kalmucks have settled quite to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
river Volga. Few of them are agriculturists, it being
their preference to wander over the pastures with their
flocks. Their religion is a debased form of Buddhism
grafted on their ancient fetichism. In physical type
they are true Asiatics, and are of a restless, warlike
disposition.</p>

<p>In the extended region which they inhabit, stretching
over seventy degrees of longitude, they have had
space to multiply until their numbers once became a
menace to all other nations of the Eurasian continent.
Under Genghis Khan, in the beginning of the thirteenth
century, they poured down in countless hordes
on the cultivated nations of Asia and Europe, and in a
few years established a monarchy, the then greatest in
the world. About a century later his descendant, the
sanguinary Tamerlane, swept Asia from the Indian
Ocean to the Arctic circle; and at the close of yet another
century Baber, of the same redoubted lineage,
founded the empire of the Great Mogul (Mongol) in
India, extending from the Indus to the Ganges. Based,
however, on despotism, barbarism and fanaticism,
these gigantic states disappeared in a few generations,
leaving scarcely a trace of their existence except the
ruins of the higher civilizations which they had
destroyed.</p>

<h3><i>3. The Tataric Group.</i></h3>

<p>Derived its name from the Chinese word <i>ta-ta</i>, and
is incorrectly written <i>Tartar</i>. Another Chinese name
applied to them was <i>Tu-kiu</i>, from which is derived
our word “Turk.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>The earliest home of the Tatars or Turks was in
Turkestan, north of the Plateau of Pamir and in the
immediate vicinity of the Persian Aryans. Long before
the beginning of the Christian era their predatory
bands had repeatedly invaded the territory of the
Aryans and the Semites, and quite down to two centuries
ago the states which they had founded were
looked upon with dread by the mightiest potentates of
Europe. The Chinese annals speak of their inroads
into that empire more than 200 years before our era.</p>

<p>At the period of the migration of nations which
accompanied the dismemberment and fall of the Roman
Empire, the Tatars appeared frequently in Europe,
always as ruthless devastators. Attila, “the
scourge of God,” with his bands of Huns, the Avari,
and the Bulgari, who followed in his wake, the Turcomans
and the Cossacks, and finally the Osmanli Turks
whose descendants now govern European and Asiatic
Turkey, and whose Sultan is the political head of the
Mohammedan world, all belong in this group.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that in these rovings they have
undergone much admixture. The modern Turk has
more of the blood of the Semite and the Circassian in
his veins than of his Tartar ancestors; but his language
has maintained a singular purity, and the Tartar hunter,
the Jakout, in the delta of the Lena on the frozen
ocean, finds no difficulty in understanding its ordinary
expressions. The Jakout speaks indeed the purest
and most ancient form of the idiom, “The Sanscrit of
the Tatar,” as it has been called by Friedrich Müller.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<p>The peculiarity of this language is that it has a law
of vocalic harmony, by which the various suffixes
added to the root change the vowels they contain in
accordance with the vowel of the root. It has not
only a pleasing sound, but superior flexibility and an
unusual capacity to express fine shades of meaning.
It is, however, losing ground both in Europe and
Asia, as are all the agglutinative languages.</p>

<p>Next to the Turks, the Cossacks and Kirghis Tatars
are prominent members of the stock. They are closely
related, being branches of the same dialectic family.
The former wander over the steppes between the Sea
of Aral and the main chain of the Altai. It is not
known when they occupied this region, but it was
within historic times, and they drove from it a people
of higher civilization, acquainted with the use of
bronze and brass, and dwellers in cities.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> The Kirghis
themselves build no houses, but dwell in felt tents
called “yourts.” They did not cultivate the soil, deriving
their food from their flocks and herds, but of
late years have begun a careless agriculture. In religion
they profess Mohammedanism, but in reality
they cling to their ancient Shamanistic superstitions.</p>

<h4>4. <i>The Finnic Group</i></h4>

<p>Has lived for certainly two thousand years or more in
Northern Europe. It is mentioned by Tacitus, and its
traditions as well as its dialects support this antiquity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
That it ever extended, as many theorists pretend, into
Central or Southern Europe, may now be dismissed
as an obsolete hypothesis, disproved by craniological
studies and a closer scrutiny of the alleged linguistic
resemblances which have been urged. The probability
is that the Finns and Lapps had the same ancestors
as the Samoyeds of Northern Siberia, who once lived
on the upper streams of the Yenissei in the Sajanic
mountains and around Lake Baikal. The Laplanders
are said still to retain some reminiscence of the migration,
and the verbal affinities of the Finnic and Samoyedic
demonstrate an early relationship.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>The eastern members of the group are the Ugrians
in the government of Tobolsk, some tribes on the
Volga, and the Permians on the Kama river (an affluent
of the Volga). The Magyars of Hungary are a
branch of the Ugrians who possessed themselves of
the land in the ninth century, and who still retain their
language, not remote from the Finnish.</p>

<p>The present Finnland was first occupied by the
Lapps or Laplanders, who were driven northward and
westward by bands continually arriving from the east.
The Finns, who call themselves “Suomi,” which is
the same as the initial syllables of “Samo-yed,” are
subdivided into the Esthonians and Livonians on the
Baltic, south of the Gulf of Finland, the Tavastes,
Karelians, and others to the north.</p>

<p>The physical type of the members of the Finnic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
group has given rise to much discussion. Many individuals
are blondes, with light hair and eyes, and with
dolichocephalic skulls. Such are especially numerous
among the Esthonians, Karelians, and Tavastes. But
it must be remembered that for two or three thousand
years these tribes have been in contact with the blonde
and dolichocephalic type of the Aryans, represented
by the ancient Teutonic and Slavonic groups (see
Lect. V). It is not in the least surprising therefore
to find the Finnic group everywhere deeply infused
with Aryac blood. Even the remote Lapps are no
exception. Nominally there are 25,000 or more of
them. But Prince Roland Bonaparte says as the result
of his recent observations among them, “Pure
Lapps no longer exist;”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> and when this is true of that
isolated people, how much more is it of the tribes in
closer proximity to the Eurafrican race? We may
conclude with Professor Keane that the genuine traits
of the Finnic group are “fundamentally and typically
Mongolic,” <i>i. e.</i>, Sibiric.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>There is no reason to suppose that any of the Sibiric
peoples extended southerly in Asia or Europe much
beyond their present boundaries. It has been a mania
with many ethnographers, especially linguistic ethnographers,
to discover “Turanian” peoples and dialects
in numerous parts of southern and central Europe.
They would have it that the Basques, the Etruscans,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
the Ligurians, the Pelasgians, were “Turanian;”
that the prehistoric inhabitants of Palestine, the Hittites,
and the Shepherd Kings of Egypt, were also of
this ilk. They are like those other ethnographers who
find “Mongoloid” indications everywhere, in America,
in Polynesia, even among the Bushmen of South
Africa. As Friedrich Müller says of these writers,
“Mongolian” is a sack into which everything is
crammed by them. There is no true science in catching
at superficial resemblances or exalting remote analogies
while fixed distinctions are disregarded.</p>

<h4><i>5. The Arctic Group.</i></h4>

<p>In northeastern Siberia, close to the Arctic circle,
and occupying the territory between the Pacific and
Arctic oceans, dwell a number of tribes in a condition
of barbarism. Their languages are in general form of
the Sibiric type; their physical traits vary, indicating
frequent admixture. In color they are rather dark,
and the skull is generally slightly dolichocephalic.</p>

<p>Of these the Chukchis occupy the extreme northeast
of the continent. Nordenskjold, who saw much
of them, considers them the mixed descendants of various
tribes, driven from more hospitable regions to the
south.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> Some of them have a marked Mongolic aspect,
but the majority differ from that type. They are
yellowish-brown in color, prominent nose, tall in
stature, and well built. They are active hunters and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
fishermen. The Namollos are a sedentary branch of
the Chukchis, and both are related to the Koraks and
Kamschatkans. The Namollos live along the Arctic
coast, near East Cape, while the Koraks live to the
south. “Kora” means “reindeer,” and they are essentially
the reindeer people, that useful animal being
their chief wealth. Close to East Cape, and southward
along the coast of Behring sea, are Eskimo tribes.
They have lived there from the first discovery of the
coast, and doubtless long before. Indeed, as far as
tradition goes, the movements of the Eskimos have
been from America into Asia, and not the reverse, until
they were driven back by the advancing Chukchis.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>The Kamschatkans to the south are of small
stature, but strongly formed. They live upon fish,
and are skillful in the use of dogs for sleds. They
number only about 2000 souls, and are disappearing.</p>

<p>The Ghiliaks live near the mouth of the Amoor
river and on the Saghalin islands. They are a mixed
people, the cephalic index varying from 74 to 85; some
of them have abundant beards, which is very rare
among the pure Asiatics.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>The Aleutians, who occupy the long chain of islands
reaching from Kamschatka to Alaska, are of medium
height, flat nose, black eyes and hair, and mesocephalic.
They belong to the American, not to the
Asian race.</p>

<p>Most of these peoples speak tongues differing widely
among themselves, but of the agglutinative type.
They are in no way related to the American languages,
and are equally remote from the Mongolian.</p>

<h4><i>6. The Japanese Group.</i></h4>

<p>The Japanese cannot claim purity of descent. Their
complexion and frequent crisp or wavy hair indicate
that their Asian origin has been modified by other
blood. They were not the earliest inhabitants of the
archipelago they occupy, but moved into it probably
about a thousand years before the Christian era.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>
The immigrants seem from some linguistic evidence
to have come from Manchuria or Mongolia, and to
have found upon the islands a different people, the
Ainos (properly Ainu) remarkable for their heavy
beards and hairy persons. These have now been
driven to the northernmost portion of the archipelago,
where about 1200 of them still reside. It was long
thought that the languages of the Ainos and Japanese
have some affinities, but except in loan words and a
general phonetic resemblance, this has now been disproved.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
The Ainos seem physically related to the
Ghiliaks, and came from the north and west. They
are supposed to have been the first occupants of the
Kurile islands.</p>

<p>Like other mixed peoples, the Japanese vary so
much in height, form of skull, hue and bodily proportion,
that it is impracticable to set up any fixed type
for them, further than to say that their general Asiatic
aspect is usually unmistakable to the trained eye.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>
In mental qualities they are gifted, being intelligent,
artistic, brave, kind, and honorable, fully alive to the
benefits of a high civilization, and able to accept with
profit all that the western world has to offer.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> They
are monogamists, and the position of woman has always
been respected among them. The prevailing
religion is the Shintoism or worship of the powers of
nature, but Buddhism, introduced in the 7th century,
has also many votaries. At heart, however, they are
an irreligious people, like the Chinese, and are unconcerned
about the ideal and the mystical. Many of
their arts, like that of writing, were at first learned
from the Chinese; but they have improved upon them,
and given them other directions, as in the development
of their phonetic from the Chinese syllabic
alphabet.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>

<p>Japanese art has attracted in recent years the admiration
of the European world, and many motives in
it have been accepted by our lovers of decorative
effects. It is indeed wonderful in its technical finish,
and its theory of composition has novelties which are
worthy of imitation, but it is devoid of that something
which we call the ideal; and its canon of proportion of
the human body has never been developed to approach
the classical models.</p>

<p>There is an extensive literature in the Japanese
tongue. Most of it deals with practical subjects, and
even the poetry is usually didactic in spirit.</p>

<p>The Koreans seem originally to have come from the
same stock as the ancestors of the Japanese. They
are of more positive Asiatic type, and are a mixed
people, the ruling class (the Kaoli) having conquered
the peninsula in the second century before our era.
They closely resemble the Loochoo islanders, and
doubtless are consanguine with them. Their industries
are similar to those of Japan, which country,
indeed, obtained many of its arts from China by way
of the Korean peninsula.

<p>It was Darwin’s theory that the distant progenitor
of man was an amphibious marine animal, and certainly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
from earliest times he has had a predilection for
water-ways and the sea-coast. The lines of these have
always directed his wanderings, and it is not surprising
therefore that nowhere do we find the physical types of
the race so confusingly amalgamated as in the insular
littoral peoples. Not only is transit easier in these
localities, but on islands especially there is a more
rapid intermingling and a closer interbreeding than is
apt to occur in continental areas. This not only
blends types, but it has another effect. It is well
known from observation on the lower animals that
such close unions result in the formation of more
plastic organisms, liable to present wide variations, and
to develop into contrasting characters.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> This holds
good also of mental products. For instance, you
might suppose that the dialects of the same island or
the same small archipelago would offer very slight
differences. The reverse is the case. In the same
area the dialects of an island differ far more than on
the mainland. This is a fact well known to linguists,
and is parallel to the physical variations.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> The ethnographer,
therefore, is prepared to attach less importance
to corporeal and linguistic differences in insular
than in continental peoples.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span></p>

<p><i>Physical Geography of Oceanica.</i>&mdash;The island world
of the Indian and Pacific Oceans is divided geologically
into two regions, Australasia and Polynesia.
The former, as its name denotes, is really a southeasterly
prolongation of the continent of Asia, and
was united to it in late tertiary times. The huge
islands of Sumatra, Java and Borneo are separated
from the Malayan and Siamese peninsulas by channels
scarcely a couple of hundred feet deep; and from
these a chain of islands extends uninterruptedly to
the semi-continent of Australia. All these islands
are of tertiary formation, and the subsidence which
separated them from the main took place at the close
of that geologic epoch.</p>

<p>The Polynesian islands, on the other hand, are of
recent construction. They are submarine towers of
coral, erected on the crests of sunken mountain ranges
rising on the floor of a profoundly deep sea. Nevertheless
the flora and fauna of Polynesia resemble that
of Australasia in its strongly Asiatic character.</p>

<p>The islands of the Indian Ocean present some singular
anomalies. Ceylon, though so close to the Indian
peninsula, is not a geological fragment of it; while
Madagascar, though four thousand miles away, was
unquestionably once a part of Southern Hindostan.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a>
This, however, was in remote eocene tertiary times,
and long before man appeared. The hypothesis, therefore,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
advanced by Hæckel and favored by Peschel and
other ethnographers, that the Indian Ocean was once
filled by the continent “Lemuria,” and that there man
appeared on the globe, must be dismissed so far as
man is concerned, as in conflict with more accurate
observations.</p>

<p>Yet one must acknowledge that it has some plausibility
from the present ethnography of the islands and
coasts of the Indian Ocean. There is a general consensus
of opinion that the earliest occupants of these
regions were an undersized black race, resembling in
many respects the negrillos of Austafrica. Upon these
was superimposed an Asiatic stock represented by the
modern Malays; and the union of these two strains
gave rise to the anomalous tribes which occupy Southern
Hindostan, Australia, and some of the islands.</p>

<p>This historic scheme, which has a great deal in its
favor, permits me to classify the great island-world
and its adjacent mainland into three ethnographic
categories as represented on the diagram.</p>

<p>Of these the most ancient is</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Negritic Stock.</span></h3>

<p>This embraces three subdivisions, (1) the Negritos,
(2) the Papuas, (3) the Melanesians.</p>

<h4><i>1. The Negrito Group.</i></h4>

<p>The Negritos may be called the western branch of the
stock. It is noteworthy that they are located nearer
to Africa, and that they more distinctly resemble the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
Negrillo stock of that continent than do the Papuas.
To them belong the natives of the Andaman Islands
known as Mincopies, the Semangs, Mantras, and Sakaies
of Malacca, the Aetas of the Philippine Islands,
and the Schobaengs of the Nicobar Isles.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> It is highly
probable that they inhabited a large part of Southern
Hindostan, perhaps before it was united to the Himalayan
highlands (see p. 88), and some have been reported
in Formosa.</p>

<p>They are believed to have been the original possessors
of Borneo, Java, Sumatra and the Celebes Islands,
as well as parts of Indo-China; but except in some
mixed tribes, as the Mois of the latter region, their
stock has disappeared from those localities. It is
noteworthy that not a trace of their blood has been
found in Asia north of the Hindu Cush and Himalaya
ranges.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> Some writers have thought that they proceeded
along the eastern islands as far north as the
Japanese archipelago, and would explain some of the
present physical traits of its inhabitants by an ancient
infusion of Negritic blood.</p>

<p>In physical aspect they are of small stature, not
more than one-fourth of the adult males reaching five
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
feet in height; their color is black, hair woolly, nearly
beardless, and the body smooth. The nose is flat, the
face moderately prognathic, and the skull generally
globular (mesocephalic index 80°-81°), but on the
Philippines and in Indo-China rather dolichocephalic.
Their forms are symmetrical, though they are thin-legged,
without calves; their movements agile and
graceful.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>They are averse to culture, and depend on hunting
and fishing. As weapons, they know the bow and
arrow, the lance, and the sarbacane or blow-pipe, but
have not acquired the art of chipping stone. When
they use that material, they split it by exposure to fire.
They are timid and distrustful of strangers, and they
well may be, as they have been pursued remorselessly
by slave-catching pirates, and were constantly exposed
to the brutal aggressions of their stronger neighbors.</p>

<p>The portrait presented of their tribal customs is
rather pleasing. The social organization is based on
the family, the heads of which elect the tribal chieftain,
and their respect for the dead amounts to a religion.
Beyond the ancestral worship they have few rites,
though some ceremonies are performed to appease the
evil spirits, and others at the time of full moon and
thunderstorms, and at births and deaths. Among
their myths is one relating to a mythical great serpent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
who seems to be a beneficent deity, pointing out to
them where game abounds, and where the bees have
deposited wild honey. They are monogamous, and
neither steal nor buy their wives, the lover arranging
the matter with his chosen one, and then sending a
present to her father. They have learned the luxury
of tobacco, and prize it highly, but for alcoholic beverages
they have no longing. As they are migratory,
their house building is limited to shelters of light materials,
and for clothing a breech-cloth is sufficient.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>In so many respects, geographical as well as physical,
do these dwarfish blacks stand between the Negro
peoples of Austafrica and Australasia that we are not
surprised at the conclusion suggested by Prof. W. H.
Flower, that they may be “the primitive type from
which the African Negroes on the one hand, and the
Melanesians on the other, may have sprung.”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<h4><i>2. The Papuan Group</i></h4>

<p>Is found in its purity on the great island of New
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
Guinea and the chains east and west of it, but even
there it discloses considerable diversity. In color the
Papuas vary from a coal black to a dark brown,
their hair is woolly, and there is considerable on the
body and face, stature medium, legs thin. Their lips
are thick, and the nostrils broad, but the nose is high
and curved. Yet the best observers agree that they
vary extremely in physiognomy, and that in New
Guinea, tribes of equally pure blood have the skull
sometimes broad, sometimes long. These variations
we may attribute to the influence of insular conditions,
or to some intermixture of blood.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>The Papuas belong to the lowest stages of culture.
Some of their tribes do not know the bow and arrow,
and few of them have any pottery. Their languages
are agglutinating, but have this peculiarity, that the
modifications of the root are generally by prefixes instead
of suffixes, in this respect reminding one of the
African rather than the Sibiric families of tongues.</p>

<p>Their territory includes parts of the New Hebrides,
the Loyalty Isles, New Caledonia, Viti, and a variety
of smaller groups. These islanders are usually of
mixed type, and are known as “Melanesians.” The
natives of the Feejee Islands are an excellent specimen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
of these, and their archipelago forms the dividing line
between the Papuan and Polynesian groups.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<h4><i>3. The Melanesian Group.</i></h4>

<p>The Melanesians, of all the islanders, present in
individual cases the strongest likeness to the equatorial
African Negro; yet among these there is that prevailing
variability of type so frequent in insular peoples.
Their color passes from the black of the typical Negro
to the yellow of the Malayan; their hair, generally
frizzly, may be quite straight and of any hue from
black to blonde. These variations are in individuals
or families, and are not owing to mixed blood.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p>

<p>Unlike the Polynesians, the Melanesians are agricultural
in habits, and sedentary. They build artistically
decorated houses, are acquainted with the bow and
arrow, occasionally make pottery, and construct
shapely canoes, though not given to long voyages.
The women are modest and chaste, and their religion
is principally a form of ancestral worship.</p>

<p>The languages of these islanders betray their compound
origin. In form and in the pronominal elements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
they stand related to the Malayan and Polynesian
idioms, and in structure approach sometimes
the richness of the former. In the Viti, for example,
both prefixes and suffixes are employed, and the
possessive is added to the noun. The root words are
monosyllables or dissyllables, and drawn from the
Papuan idioms, and the phonetics are much richer
than the Polynesian.</p>

<p>These facts go to show that the Melanesians are
physically and linguistically a mixed people, a compound
of the woolly-haired black Papuas, whom we
may suppose to have been the aborigines of Melanesia,
with the smooth-haired, light-colored Malays, who
reached the archipelago as adventurers and immigrants.
As their tongues form, as it were, the second
stratum of structure when compared with the Polynesian
dialects, we can go a step further and say that
the ethnic formation of the Melanesian islanders occurred
subsequently to the construction of the Polynesian
physical type and languages.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p>The ethnic relationship of the various adjoining
islanders to the Papuas has been studied by many
observers, but its solution has not yet been reached.
The Papuas themselves impressed Hale as partly
Malayan&mdash;“a hybrid race,”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> and Virchow calls attention
to the fact that a broad zone of wavy-haired peoples
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
intervene between the Papuas and the pure
Malays, shading off into the Australians on the one
hand and the Veddahs of Ceylon on the other.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> This
is very significant of the ethnic origin of the inhabitants
of Australasia.</p>

<p>It is borne out by an examination of the Papuan
languages. These are quite dissimilar among themselves,
and appear to have been derived from a number
of independent linguistic stocks. While these were
originally distinct from the Malayan, it is a recognized
fact that all the Papuan, and still more all the
Melanesian dialects, have absorbed extensively from
Malayan and Polynesian sources, and we are certain,
therefore, that a similar absorption of Malayan blood
has taken place.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Malayic Stock</span></h3>

<p>Is by far the most important group of peoples with
whom we have to do in the area we are now studying.
Many ethnologists, indeed, set it up as a distinct
race, the “Malayan” or “Brown” race, and claim
for it an importance not less than any of the darker
varieties of the species. It bears, however, the marks
of an origin too recent, and presents Asian analogies
too clearly, for it to be regarded otherwise than as a
branch of the Asian race, descended like it from some
ancestral tribe in that great continent. Its dispersion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
has been extraordinary. Its members are found almost
continuously on the land areas from Madagascar to
Easter Island, a distance nearly two-thirds of the circumference
of the globe; everywhere they speak dialects
with such affinities that we must assume for all
one parent stem, and their separation must have taken
place not so very long ago to have permitted such a
monoglottic trait as this.</p>

<p>The stock is divided at present into two groups, the
western or Malayan peoples, and the eastern or Polynesian
peoples. There has been some discussion about
the original identity of these, but we may consider it
now proved by both physical, linguistic and traditional
evidence.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> The original home of the parent stem has
also excited some controversy, but this too may be
taken as settled. There is no reasonable doubt but
that the Malays came from the southeastern regions of
Asia, from the peninsula of Farther India, and thence
spread south, east and west over the whole of the island
world. Their first occupation of Sumatra and Java
has been estimated to have occurred not later than
1000 B. C., and probably was a thousand years earlier,
or about the time that the Aryans entered Northern
India.</p>

<p>The relationship of the Malayic with the other Asian
stocks has not yet been made out. Physically they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
stand near to the Sinitic peoples of small stature and
roundish heads of southeastern Asia.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> The oldest
form of their language, however, was not monosyllabic
and tonic, but was dissyllabic. Structurally, it was
largely of the “isolating” type, the relations of the
members of the proposition being expressed by loose
words, as is still the case in some of the Polynesian
dialects. This is scarcely recognizable in the developed
Malayan and Tagala idioms where there is a
richly varied structure by suffixes, prefixes and infixes;
but the building up of these grammatical resources
can be traced back from the simple original
tongue, or <i>Ursprache</i>, I have mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> We cannot
be far wrong, therefore, in associating in some remote
past the ancestral Malays, with their isolating, dissyllabic
speech, yellowish-brown complexion, short skulls
and small stature, with the Indo-Chinese group of the
Sinitic branch of the Asian race.</p>

<h4><i>1. The Western or Malayan Group.</i></h4>

<p>The purest type of the true Malays is seen in Malacca,
Sumatra and Java. They are of medium or
slightly under size, the complexion from olive to
brown. The hair is black, straight and lank, and the
beard is scanty. The eyes are black, often slightly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
oblique, the nose straight and rather prominent, the
mouth large, and the chin well developed. The skull
is short (brachycephalic), and the muscular force less
than the European average.</p>

<p>This type is found among the Malayans of Malacca
and Sumatra, the Javanese, the Madurese and Tagalas.
It has changed slightly by foreign intermixture among
the Battaks of Sumatra, the Dayaks of Borneo, the
Alfures and the Bugis. But the supposition that these
are so remote that they cannot properly be classed
with the Malays is an exaggeration of some recent
ethnographers, and is not approved by the best authorities.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>
The chief differences are that the Battak type
is larger and stronger than the average Malay, the
skull is more oval, the hair finer in texture and lighter
in color.</p>

<p>In character the Malays are energetic, quick of perception,
genial in demeanor, but unscrupulous, cruel
and revengeful. Veracity is unknown, and the love of
gain is far stronger than any other passion or affection.
This thirst for gold made the Malay the daring navigator
he early became. As merchant, pirate or explorer,
and generally as all three in one, he pushed his
crafts far and wide over the tropical seas through
twelve thousand miles of extent.</p>

<p>On the extreme west he reached and colonized Madagascar.
The Hovas there, undoubtedly of Malay
blood, number about 800,000 in a population of five
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
and a half millions, the remainder being Negroids of
various degrees of fusion. In spite of this disproportion,
the Hovas are the recognized masters of the
island. Their language stands in closest relation to
that of the Battaks of Sumatra. In physical appearance
they have a striking likeness to the Polynesians,
so close, indeed, that the one may readily be mistaken
for the other.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p>On the great islands near the Malaccan peninsula
there are tribes in different stages of culture. Those
on the highest plane are the Javanese, whose ancient
language, the Kavi, is preserved in their sacred books.
The Battaks of Northern Sumatra are an agricultural
people, who have not accepted Islam, and belong to
the old stock of the Asian immigrants. They are still
to some extent cannibals, a convict condemned to
death being eaten by the community. The Dayaks
of Borneo are not less truculent, being cannibals and
famous “head hunters”&mdash;that is, their highest trophy
of war and proof of manhood is to bring home the head
of a slain enemy. Some of them are agriculturists,
others sea robbers. Their dwellings are of the communal
character, and their religion an idolatry, the
figures of the gods being carved in wood.</p>

<p>The Macassars of the Celebes and the Tagalas of
the Philippines are Malays of milder habits, and
possess commercial importance and literary culture.
In these islanders there is a mixed class called Alfures,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
who have attracted some attention as differing from
the prevalent type, but they are of no ethnographic
importance.</p>

<p>The Malays probably established various colonies
in Southern India. The natives at Travancore and the
Sinhalese of Ceylon bear a strongly Malayan aspect.
But the latter speak a dialect largely Aryac, and the
Veddahs in the interior of the island have a much
lower cephalic index than the Malay (about 72), and
their language is derived about one-half from Aryac
and the rest from Dravidian (Tamil) sources.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<h4><i>2. The Eastern or Polynesian Group.</i></h4>

<p>Some ethnographers would make the Polynesians
and Micronesians a different race from the Malays;
but the farthest that one can go in this direction is to
admit that they reveal some strain of another blood.
This is evident in their physical appearance. They
are uncommonly tall, symmetrical and handsome, a
stature over six feet not being unusual among them.
Their features are regular, their color a light brown.
Their hair is black, smooth and glossy, sometimes
with a curl or crisp in it, which betrays a touch of
Papuan blood. All the Polynesian languages have
some affinities to the Malayan, and the Polynesian
traditions unanimously refer to the west for the home
of their ancestors. We are able, indeed, by carefully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
analyzing these traditions, to trace with considerable
accuracy both the route they followed to the Oceanic
isles and the respective dates when they settled them.</p>

<p>Thus, the first station of their ancestors on leaving
the western group, was the small island of Buru or
Boru, between Celebes and New Guinea. Here they
encountered the Papuas, some of whom still dwell in
the interior, while the coast people are fair.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> Leaving
Boru, they passed to the north of New Guinea, colonizing
the Caroline and Solomon Islands, but the
vanguard pressing forward to take possession of Savai
in the Samoan group and Tonga to its south. These
two islands formed a second centre of distribution
over the western Pacific. The Maoris of New Zealand
moved from Tonga&mdash;“holy Tonga” as they call
it in their songs&mdash;about six hundred years ago. The
Society islanders migrated from Savai, and they in
turn sent forth the population of the Marquesas, the
Sandwich Islands and Easter Island.</p>

<p>The separation of the Polynesians from the western
Malays must have taken place about the beginning of
our era. This length of time permits the best adjustment
of their several traditions, and is not so long as to
render it difficult to explain the similarity of their dialects
and usages.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<p>The disposition of the Polynesian is an improvement
on that of the Malay. He is more to be trusted, and
is more affable. In culture he is backward. Pottery
is scarcely known, agriculture is not carried on, cannibalism
was nigh universal, polygamy was prevalent,
and the relation of the sexes was exceedingly loose,
especially among the unmarried. The islanders, as
may be expected, are singularly skilful navigators
and build excellent canoes. They do not hesitate to
undertake voyages of five or six hundred miles, and
are such excellent swimmers that if the boat capsizes
they are in no danger of drowning. Their weapons
were the lance, the sling and club, but they were not
acquainted with the bow and arrow.</p>

<p>Their religion, until the introduction of Christianity,
was a frank polytheism. The deeds of the gods
are related in long chants, which also contain many
historic references.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> The word “taboo” comes from
Polynesia, and means “sacred,” “holy.” All objects
which the priests declared “taboo” were considered
to be consecrated to the supernatural powers, and to
touch them was to incur sure death. They were accustomed
to set apart enclosures which were “taboo,”
and served as temples, and the images of the gods, in
wood or stone, rudely carved, were there erected.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>Although their houses were generally of brush and
leaves, on several of the islands they constructed stone
edifices. Such are found upon the Caroline islands, on
sacred Tonga, on Pitcairn, and on Easter island, the last
mentioned have excited particular attention, and have
given rise to various foolish theories about a previous
race of high culture, and about relationship to the civilized
American nations of Peru and Central America.
It is enough to say that nothing on Easter island is
peculiar to its culture. There are stone platforms
with rude stone images on them thirty or forty feet
high; there are the foundations of stone houses; there
are remains of a primitive ideographic writing. All
these occur also on the other islands I have named,
and the natives of Rapa-nui, as the island is called by
the Tahitians, have nothing in their language or arts
to distinguish them from other Polynesians. The pre-historic
colossal structures on Ponape, Lalla and
others of the Caroline group, are of basalt, and testify
to a creditable ambition and skill on the part of the
builders; but careful investigations prove that they
are “without any doubt” to be attributed to the ancestors
of the present inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">The Australic Stock.</span></h3>

<p>Under the heading of the Australic branch, I would
class together the primitive inhabitants of the peninsula
of Hindostan and of the semi-continent of Australia.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>The collocation may seem hazardous, but it has its
reasons. The physical traits of the two are not remote.
In both the hair is black and curly, showing
Negritic blood, the skull is medium or long, the lips
are full, the nose not prominent, the color brown, and
there is a beard. The relationship of the Australians
to some of the hill tribes of central India has been referred
to as possible by the naturalist Wallace, and
the linguist Caldwell finds Australian analogies in the
Dravidian tongues, and points out that both are of the
agglutinative type, and with family resemblances.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
The suggestion seems close at hand that the Australian
is a compound of the Negritic stock of Australasia
with the Malay, the Dravidian perhaps with the Malay,
and also with some other Asian people.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> The English
ethnologist, C. Staniland Wake, has advanced an
almost equivalent theory to the effect that a straight-haired
stock combined with the Australasian Negrito
to form the Australians, but this straight-haired people
he would attach to the “Caucasian” (Eurafrican)
race, for which there is little or no evidence.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<h4><i>1. The Australian Group</i></h4>

<p>Occupies the whole semi-continent of Australia and
the island of Tasmania south of it. The last of the
Tasmanians perished some years ago, and Carl Lumholtz,
one of the most recent of Australian explorers,
calculates the survivors of the native inhabitants of
that continent at not over 30,000 individuals of pure
blood.</p>

<p>Their appearance differs considerably, although it is
generally conceded that they speak related idioms, and
originally came from one lineage and language. The
Tasmanians had quite frizzly or woolly hair, and according
to reliable observers correspond closely in
habits and appearance to the Papuas.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> Among the
Australians of the north and northeast coast this resemblance
is still accentuated, and no wonder, when
the islands in Torres straits, one in sight of the other,
form natural stepping stones from New Guinea to
Australia. On the west coast the hair is straighter,
and the signs of Malay blood are obvious. The color
varies from dark to light brown, and the beard is generally
full, the body being also well supplied with
hair.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<p>The culture status of the Australians is generally
put at the very lowest. Their roving tribes are without
government, they do not till the ground, they go
naked, and do not know the bow and arrow. Their
weapons are the spear and the boomerang, a crooked
club which they throw at the object. The story that
it returns to the thrower is only true of some used in
sport (Lumholtz). Marriage among them is by robbery
or purchase, and the women are treated with deliberate
cruelly. Cannibalism in its most revolting
form is usual, and the sick are deserted. Their religion
is a low fetichism, and they have no idols nor
forms of worship. Certain rites, as fasting, sacrificing,
and solemn dancing, clearly have reference to the
supposed supernatural powers. In some parts, however,
they draw figures of animals with charcoal on the
sides of caves, and manufacture rude stone carvings.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>
They chip flakes into spear-points, and are skilful in
making fire from friction, in catching animals and
other simple arts. Their songs are numerous, and are
chanted in correct time.</p>

<p>The <i>corroborees</i>, or dances, constitute their principal
religious and social festivals. These are usually celebrated
at night, by the light of great fires, and accompanied
by a horrible clangor, which passes for music,
produced from drums, flutes, and a sort of tambourine.
The chants relate to adventures in war and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
love, in boasting recitals, and in descriptions of ancestral
power. The initiation of the young of both
sexes into the duties of adult life is always accompanied
with some solemnities, such as fasting, incising
the flesh in lines so as to leave prominent scars, cutting
the hair, breaking one or more teeth, and with local
mutilations of a painful and shocking character.</p>

<p>As usual among the primitive peoples, sickness and
death are regarded, not as natural events, but as the
maleficent action of evil spirits or living enemies.
When ill, therefore, the services of the priest or magician
is called in to counteract the sorcery and to
name the adversary who sets it on foot. These adepts
employ the same Shamanistic practices, rubbing, blowing,
sucking, howling, which are popular with them
everywhere, and if these fail, at least at death they can
suggest who the hidden enemy has been, and thus
furnish a pretext for the avenger of blood to start
forth on his murderous mission.</p>

<p>In some parts the dead are burned; in others, the
flesh is scraped from the bones, or the body is exposed
until they are cleaned by the ants and other animals,
and then they are carefully collected and placed in an
ossuary; or again, the body is buried in the hut where
the death took place, this is torn down and thrown on
the grave, and the place is deserted. The spirits of
the dead are supposed to haunt the place where the
body is left, and as a rule to exercise an evil influence
on the living. Food is occasionally placed on the
grave, and some ceremonies of mourning are repeated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
for eleven months; usually, the survivors refrain from
repeating the name of the deceased, even if it is a
word of common use.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>Rudimentary as was their culture, it is interesting
to notice that they had developed the conception of
writing. They were accustomed to send information,
and even describe events, by incising peculiarly formed
notches, lines and figures on pieces of wood, called
“message sticks.” These would be sent by runners
for hundreds of miles, and could be read by the recipient
through the conventional meanings assigned
to the characters.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<h4><i>2. The Dravidian Group.</i></h4>

<p>I have already given you a description of the general
appearance of the Dravidas or Dravidians.
There is some physical resemblance among them all,
but here the similarity ceases, as they vary greatly in
culture and language. They are held to have been
the pre-Aryac population of India, and one of their
tribes, the Brahui, is found north of the mountains,
in Beloochistan. When the Aryans entered India,
about two thousand years before our era, they either
subjugated, destroyed or drove to the south these
earlier possessors of the soil. They either became the
lowest caste in the Aryac states, the “sudras,” or they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
fled to the swamps and hills. Their total number at
present is about 50,000,000.</p>

<p>Linguistically they are divisible into two distinct
groups, the Dravidas proper, and the Mundas. To
the former belong the Tamuls, the Telugus, the Canarese,
the Malayalas, the Todas, the Khonds, and
other tribes of less importance. The skin of all these
is brown, the hair curly, the head tending to dolichocephaly.
The Todas of the Neilghery hills are regarded
as of unusually pure blood. They are tall,
with full beards and prominent noses, the hair black
and bushy. Undoubtedly many of the Dravidas partake
of Aryac blood through the long domination of
that stock.</p>

<p>Most of the Dravida nations are cultured, possessing
a written language and a literature. They are
pastoral and agricultural in habits, and usually the
women are well treated, and enjoy a certain degree of
freedom. Monogamy is the prevalent custom, but
polyandry (see p. 53) is frequent, and infanticide, particularly
of female children, is looked upon with approval.
Their religion is a nature-worship of a low
order, consisting principally of conjurations against
evil spirits and divination by sorcerers.</p>

<p>The Munda tribes include the Kohls, the Santals,
the Bhillas and others, dwelling on the highlands of
the interior, northwest of Calcutta. They are hunting
and agricultural peoples, having a better reputation
among the Europeans than their Hindoo neighbors.
The physical type among them is variable, natives of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
the same village differing in color and hair, indicating
frequent crossings with the Aryac and other
foreign stock.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="map_244" src="images/map_244.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Ethnic Chart of Hindostan.</span></p></div>

<p>The languages of the Dravidians, though of the
type called agglutinative, have no demonstrative connection
with those of the Sibiric (Altaic) stock, and
the efforts to connect them historically are visionary.
The original roots are monosyllabic, which are modified
by the addition of suffixes. These suffixes often
show the same “vocalic harmony” to which I have
referred in some of the Sibiric idioms (above, p. 212);
but its action is reversed, as while in Turkish, for
example, the vowel of the suffix alters the vowel of the
root, in Telugu it is the latter which controls the
former.</p>

<p>Although all the Dravida tongues have borrowed
more or less from the Sanscrit, it has been in words
only, and their peculiar structure stands as ever wholly
apart from all Aryac speech. There is something that
looks like inflection in them, but the case-endings are
merely particles referring to place, and not true grammatical
cases. They are still in that stage of growth
where the distinction of verb and noun is ill-defined,
and relative pronouns are absent.</p>

<p>The literature which has been developed in these
tongues is of respectable extent. That of the Tamils
of southern Hindostan and northern Ceylon stands in
the front rank. It is in both prose and poetry, special
forms of expression being characteristic of the latter.
Everywhere it reveals Aryac inspiration, and illustrates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
the general traits of the Dravidian intellect, ready
facility in imitating and adapting the forms of a higher
civilization, but limited originality and independence
of thought.

<span class="large">THE AMERICAN RACE.</span></h2>

Their culture. Other tribes.</p></blockquote>

<p>The American Race includes those tribes whom we
familiarly call “Indians,” a designation, as you know,
which perpetuates the error of Columbus, who thought
the western land he discovered was a part of India.</p>

<p>I shall not undertake to discuss those extensive
questions, Who are the Indians? and, When was
America peopled? and, By what route did the first inhabitants
come here? These knotty points I treat in
another course of lectures, where I marshal sufficient
arguments, I think, to show satisfactorily that America
was peopled during, if not before, the Great Ice Age;
that its first settlers probably came from Europe by
way of a land connection which once existed over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
northern Atlantic, and that their long and isolated residence
in this continent has moulded them all into a
singularly homogeneous race, which varies but slightly
anywhere on the continent, and has maintained its
type unimpaired for countless generations. Never at
any time before Columbus was it influenced in blood,
language or culture by any other race.</p>

<p>So marked is the unity of its type, so alike the physical
and mental traits of its members from Arctic to
Antarctic latitudes, that I cannot divide it any other
way than geographically, as follows:</p>

<p class="table">
1. Arctic Group.<br />
2. North Atlantic Group.<br />
3. North Pacific Group.<br />
4. Mexican Group.<br />
5. Inter-Isthmian Group.<br />
6. South Atlantic Group.<br />
7. South Pacific Group.<br />
</p>

<p>All the higher civilizations are contained in the Pacific
group, the Mexican really belonging to it by
derivation and original location. Between the members
of the Pacific and Atlantic groups there was very
little communication at any period, the high Sierras
walling them apart; but among the members of each
Pacific and each Atlantic group, the intercourse was
constant and extensive. The Nahuas, for instance,
spread down the Pacific from Sonora to the straits of
Panama; the Inca power stretched along the coast for
two thousand miles; but neither of these reached into
the Atlantic plains. So with the Atlantic groups; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
Guarani tongue can be traced from Buenos Ayres to
the Amazon, the Algonkin from the Savannah River
to Hudson Bay; but neither crossed the mountains to
the west. The groups therefore are cultural as well
as geographical, and represent natural divisions of
tribes as well as of regions.</p>

<p>The northernmost of this division is</p>

<h4><i>1. The Arctic Group.</i></h4>

<p>This group comprises the Eskimo and Aleutian
tribes.</p>

<p>The more correct name for the former is that which
they give themselves, <i>Innuit</i>, “men.” They are essentially
a maritime people, extending along the northern
coasts of the continent from Icy Bay in Alaska on the
west, almost to the Straits of Belle Isle on the Labrador
side. Northward they reach into Greenland,
where the Scandinavians found them about the year
1000 A. D., although it is likely that these Greenland
Eskimos had come from Labrador no long time before.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></p>

<p>Throughout the whole of this extensive distribution,
they present a most remarkable uniformity of appearance,
languages, arts and customs. The unity of their
tribes is everywhere manifest.</p>

<p>The physical appearance of the Eskimos is characteristic.
Their color is dark, hair black and coarse,
stature medium, skull generally long (dolichocephalic,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
71-73). The beard is scant and the cheek bones
high.</p>

<p>They usually have a cheerful, lively disposition, and
are much given to stories, songs and laughter. Neither
the long nights of the polar zone, nor the cruel cold
of the winters, dampens their glee. Before their
deterioration by contact with the whites, they were
truthful and honest. Their intelligence in many directions
is remarkable, and they invented and improved
many mechanical devices in advance of any
other tribes of the race. Thus, they alone on the
American continent used lamps. They make them of
stone, with a wick of dried moss. The sledge with its
team of dogs is one of their devices; and gloves, boots
and divided clothing are articles of dress not found on
the continent south of them. Their “kayak,” a light
and strong boat of sealskins stretched over a frame of
bones or wood, is the perfection of a sea-canoe. Their
carvings in bone, wood or ivory, and their outline
drawings, reveal no small degree of technical skill;
and they independently discovered the principle of the
arch and apply it to the construction of their domed
snow-houses. The principal weapons among them
are the bow and arrow and the lance.</p>

<p>The Aleutians proper live on the central and eastern
islands of the Archipelago named from them. Their
language differs wholly from the Eskimo. At present
they are largely civilized.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span></p>

<h4><i>2. The North Atlantic Group.</i></h4>

<p>The spacious water-shed of the Atlantic stretches
from the crests of the Rocky Mountains to the Eastern
Ocean. Whether the streams debouch into Hudson
Bay or the Gulf of Mexico, their waters find their way
to the Atlantic. The most of this region was in the
possession of a few linguistic stocks, whose members,
generally at war with each other, roved widely over
these lowlands.</p>

<p>The northernmost of them was the <i>Athapasca</i> stock.
Its members called themselves Tinnéh, “people,” and
they are also known as Chepewyans, an Algonkin
word meaning “pointed skins,” applied from the shape
of the skin robe they wore, pointed in front and behind.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p>Their country extended from Hudson Bay to the
Cascade Range of the Rocky Mountains, and from the
Arctic Ocean southward to a line drawn from the
mouth of the Churchill river to the mouth of the
Frazer river. The northern tribes extend westward
nearly to the delta of the Yukon river, and reach the
seacoast at the mouth of the Copper river. At some
remote period, some of its bands forsook their inhospitable
abodes in the north, and following the eastern
flanks of the Cordillera, migrated far south into
Mexico, where they form the Apaches and Navajos,
and the Lipans near the mouth of the Rio del Norte.</p>

<p>The general trend of the pre-historic migrations of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
the Tinnéh, seems to have been from a centre west of
Hudson Bay, whence they diverged north, west, and
southwest.</p>

<p>In physical features they are of average stature and
superior muscular development. The color varies
considerably, even in the same village, but tends toward
a brown. The skull is long, the face broad, and
the cheek-bones prominent.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></p>

<p>In point of culture the Tinnéh stand low. The
early missionaries who undertook the difficult task of
bringing them into accord with Christian morals have
left painful portraitures of the brutality of the lives of
their flocks. The Apaches have for centuries been
notorious for their savage dispositions and untamable
ferocity. They are, however, skilful hunters, bold
warriors, and of singular physical endurance.</p>

<p>Immediately south of the Athabascans, throughout
their whole extent, were the <i>Algonkins</i>. They extended
uninterruptedly from Cape Race, in Newfoundland,
to the Rocky Mountains, on both banks of the
St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes. The Blackfeet
were their westernmost tribe, and in Canada they embraced
the Crees, Montagnais, Micmacs, Ottawas, etc.
In the area of the United States they were known in
New England as the Abnakis, Passamaquoddies,
Pequots, etc.; on the Hudson, as Mohegans; on the
Delaware, as Lenape; in Maryland, as Nanticokes; in
Virginia, as Powhatans; while in the Ohio and Mississippi
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
valleys, the Miamis, Sacs and Foxes, Kickapoos
and Chippeways, were of this stock. Its most
southern representatives were the Shawnees, who once
lived on the Tennessee, and, perhaps, the Savannah
river, and were closely related to the Mohegans of
New York.</p>

<p>Most of these tribes were agricultural, raising
maize, beans, squash and tobacco; they occupied fixed
residences in towns most of the year; they were
skilled in chipping and polishing stone, and they had
a definite, even rigid, social organization. Their
mythology was extensive, and its legends, as well as
the history of their ancestors, were retained in memory
by a system of ideographic writing, of which a
number of specimens have been preserved. Their intellectual
capacities were strong, and the distinguished
characters that arose among them&mdash;King Philip,
Tecumseh, Black Hawk, Pontiac, Tammany, Powhatan&mdash;displayed,
in their dealings of war or peace
with the Europeans, an ability, a bravery and a sense
of right, on a par with the famed heroes of antiquity.</p>

<p>The earliest traceable seat of this widely extended
group was somewhere between the St. Lawrence
River and Hudson Bay. To this region their traditions
point, and there the language is found in its
purest and most archaic form. They apparently divided
early into two branches, the one following the
Atlantic coast southward, the other the St. Lawrence
and the Great Lakes westward. Of those that remained,
some occupied Newfoundland, others spread
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
over Labrador, where they were thrown into frequent
contact with the Eskimos.</p>

<p>Surrounded on all sides by the Algonkins, the
<i>Iroquois</i> first appear in history as occupying a portion
of the area of New York State. To the west, in the
adjoining part of Canada, were their kinsmen, the
Eries and Hurons; on the Susquehanna, in Pennsylvania,
the Conestogas; and in Virginia, the Tuscaroras.
All were closely related, but in constant feud.
Those in New York were united as the Five Nations,
and as such, are prominent figures in the early annals
of the English colony. The date of the formation of
their celebrated league is reasonably placed in the
fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Another extensively dispersed stock is that of the
<i>Dakotas</i>. Their area reached from Lake Michigan
to the Rocky Mountains, and from the Saskatchewan
to the Arkansas rivers, covering most of the valley
of the Missouri. A fragment of them, the Tuteloes,
resided in Virginia, where they were associated with
the Monacans, now extinct, but who were probably of
the same stock.</p>

<p>They are also called the Sioux. Their principal
tribes are the Assiniboins, to the north; the Hidatsa
or Crows, at the west; the Winnebagoes to the east;
the Omahas, Mandans, Otoes, and Poncas, on the Missouri;
the Osages and Kansas to the south.</p>

<p>The <i>Chahta-Muskoki</i> stock occupied the area of
what we call the Gulf States, from the Atlantic to the
Mississippi River. They comprised the Creeks or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
Muskokis, the Choctaws, Chickasaws, and later the
Seminoles. The latter took possession of Florida early
in the last century. Previously that peninsula had
been inhabited by the Timucuas, a nation now wholly
extinct, though its language is still preserved in the
works of the Spanish missionaries.</p>

<p>The Creeks and their neighbors were first visited by
Fernando de Soto in 1540, on that famous expedition
when he discovered the Mississippi. The narratives
of his campaign represent them as cultivating extensive
fields of corn, living in well fortified towns, their
houses erected on artificial mounds, and the villages
having defences of embankments of earth. These
statements are verified by the existing remains, which
compare favorably in size and construction with those
left by the mysterious “Mound Builders” of the Ohio
valley. In fact, the opinion is steadily gaining ground
that probably the builders of the Ohio earthworks
were the ancestors of the Creeks, Cherokees, and other
southern tribes.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<p>Much of the area of eastern Texas, and the land
north of it to the Platte River, were held by various
tribes of the <i>Caddoes</i>. Fragments of them are found
nearly as far north as the Canada line, and it is probable
that their migration was from this higher latitude
southerly, though their own legends referred to the
east as their first home. They depended for subsistence
chiefly on hunting and fishing, thus remaining in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
a lower stage of progress than their neighbors in the
Mississippi valley.</p>

<p>Sometimes this is called the <i>Pani</i> family, from one
of their members, the Pawnees, on the Platte River.
Their most northerly tribe was the Arickarees, who
reached to the middle Missouri, and in the south the
Witchitas were the most prominent.</p>

<p>The <i>Kioways</i> now live about the head-waters of the
Nebraska or Platte River, along the northern line of
Colorado. Formerly they roamed over the plains of
Texas, but according to an ancient tradition, they
came from some high northern latitude, and made use
of sleds.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<p>Omitting a number of small tribes, whose names
would weary you, I shall mention in the Atlantic
group the <i>Shoshonee</i> bands, called also Snake or Ute
Indians. They extended from the coast of Texas in
a northwesterly direction over New Mexico, Colorado,
Arizona and Nevada, to the borders of California, and
reached the Pacific near Santa Barbara. Many of
them are a low grade of humanity, the lowest in skull-form,
says Professor Virchow, of any he has examined
on the continent. The “Root-diggers” are
one of their tribes, living in the greatest squalor. Yet
it would be a serious error to suppose they are not
capable of better things. Many among them have
shown decided intellectual powers. Sarah Winnemucca,
a full blood Pi-Ute, was an acceptable and
fluent lecturer in the English language,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> and their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
war chiefs have at times given our army officers no
little trouble by their skill and energy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="map_256" src="images/map_256.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Indian Tribes of the United States.</span></p></div>

<p>The Comanches are the best known of the Shoshonees,
and present the finest types of the stock. They
are of average stature, straight noses, features regular,
and even handsome, and the expression manly. They
are splendid horsemen and skilful hunters, but men
never given to an agricultural life.</p>

<h4><i>3. The North Pacific Group.</i></h4>

<p>The narrow valleys of the Pacific slope are traversed
by streams rich in fish, whose wooded banks
abounded in game. Shut off from one another by
lofty ridges, they became the home of isolated tribes,
who developed in course of time peculiarities of speech,
culture and appearance. Hence it is that there is an
extraordinary diversity of stocks along that coast, and
few of them have any wide extent.</p>

<p>In the extreme north the <i>Tlinkit</i> or <i>Kolosch</i> are in
proximity to the Eskimos near Mount St. Elias. They
are an ingenious and sedentary people, living in villages
of square wooden houses, many parts of which are
elaborately carved into fantastic figures. Their canoes
are dug out of tree trunks, and are both graceful in
shape and remarkably seaworthy. With equal deftness
they manufacture clothing from skin, ornaments
from bone, ivory, wood and stone, utensils from horn
and stone, and baskets and mats from rushes.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p>To the south of them are the Haidahs of Vancouver’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
island, distantly related in language to the Tlinkit,
and closely in the arts of life. Their elaborately
carved pipes in black slate, and their intricate designs
in wood, testify to their dexterity as artists. South of
them are various stocks, the Tsimshian on the Nass and
Skeena rivers, the Nootka on the sound of that name,
the Salish, who occupy a large tract, and others.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>All the above are north of the line of the United
States. Not far south of it are the Sahaptins, or Nez
Percés, who are noteworthy for two traits, one their
language, which is to some extent inflectional, with
cases like the Latin, and the second, for their commercial
abilities. They owned the divide between the
headwaters of the Missouri and of the Columbia rivers,
and from remote times carried the products of the
Pacific slope&mdash;shells, beads, pipes, etc.&mdash;far down the
Missouri, to barter them for articles from the Mississippi
valley.</p>

<p>The coast of California was thickly peopled by many
tribes of no linguistic affinities, most of whom have
now disappeared. They offer little of interest except
to the specialist, and I shall omit their enumeration in
order to devote more time to the Pueblo Indians and
Cliff-dwellers of New Mexico, Colorado and Arizona.</p>

<p>These include divers tribes, Moquis, Zuñis, Acomas
and others, not related in language, but upon the
same plane of culture, and that one in many respects
higher than any tribe I have yet named to you. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
constructed large buildings (pueblos) of stone and
sun-dried brick, with doors and windows supported by
beams of wood; they were not only tillers of the soil,
but devised extensive systems of irrigation, by which
the water was conducted for miles to the fields; they
were both skilful and tasteful in the manufacture of
pottery and clothing; and as places of defence or
retreat they erected stone towers and lodged well-squared
stone dwellings on the ledges of the deep
cañons, known as “cliff houses.”</p>

<h4><i>4. The Mexican Group.</i></h4>

<p>The nations of leading prominence in this group
spoke the Aztec or Nahuatl tongue. On the arrival
of Cortes, they controlled the territory from the Gulf
to the Pacific, and their colonies and commerce extended
far north and south. They dwelt in populous
cities built of brick and stone, were diligent cultivators
of the soil, made use of a phonetic system of writing,
and had an ample literature preserved in books.</p>

<p>The physical traits of the Aztecs were nowise peculiar.
Their skulls were moderately long or medium,
though a few are brachycephalic, the forehead narrow,
the face broad. The hair is occasionally wavy, and
they present more beard than most of the other Indians.
The color is from light to dark brown, the
nose prominent, and the ears large. In stature they
are medium or less, strongly built and muscular.
Persons ill-made or deformed are rare, and among the
young of both sexes graceful and symmetrical forms
are not uncommon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

<p>The governments of the various nations were based
on the system of clans, gentes or totems, which was
common not only in America, but in most primitive
communities. Each gens had a right of representation,
and the land belonged to its members, not as
individuals, but as parts of the clan. The highest
officer of the State was in early times elected by the
chiefs of the gentes, but later the office became hereditary.</p>

<p>Of all the arts, that of architecture was most developed.
The pyramid of Cholula compares in magnitude
with the most stupendous results of human labor.
It has four terraces, and its base is a square, 1500 feet
on each side. Similar structures are found at Papantla,
Teotihuacan, and other localities. They are
built of earth, stone, and baked brick, and could only
have been completed by the united and directed labor
of large bodies of workmen. The cities of ancient
Mexico were many in number, and contained thousands
of houses. Tenochtitlan was surrounded by
walls of stone, and its population must have been at
least sixty thousand souls.</p>

<p>Of their cultivated plants the most important were
maize, cotton, beans, cacao and tobacco. An intoxicating
beverage, called <i>octli</i>, was prepared from the
fermented juice of the agave, but its use was limited
by stringent regulations, and repeated drunkenness
was punished with death.</p>

<p>The Aztecs were in the “bronze age” of industrial
development. Various tools, as hoes, chisels and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
scrapers, ornaments, as beads and bells, formed of an
alloy of tin and copper, and copper plates of a crescentic
shape were used as a circulating medium in some districts.
In welding and hammering gold and silver
they were the technical equals of the goldsmiths of
Europe of their day. Most of their cutting instruments,
however, were of stone.</p>

<p>They were lovers of brilliant colors, and decorated
their costumes and buildings with dyed stuffs, bright
flowers, and the rich plumage of tropical birds. Such
feathers were also woven into mantles and head-dresses
of intricate designs and elaborate workmanship,
an art now lost. Their dyes were strong and
permanent, some of them remaining quite vivid after
four centuries of exposure to the light.</p>

<p>In order to obtain the materials used in their arts
and to exchange their completed products, they carried
on an active commerce, both domestic and foreign.
All the cities had market days, when the neighboring
country people would flock in great numbers to town,
and the journeys of their merchants extended far toward
the Isthmus of Panama.</p>

<p>The national religion was a polytheism built up on
a totemic worship; that is, it was originally a nature
worship grafted upon the superstitious devotion paid
to the presiding genius of the gens. Huitzilopochtli
was the chief divinity of the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan,
Quetzalcoatl was especially adored at Cholula, and the
two Tezcatlipocas, the one dark and one white, were
other prominent mythical figures. According to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
myth these four were brothers, but engaged in a series
of contentions among themselves, which repeatedly
wrecked the world.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<p>The Nahuas were by no means the only nation who
had made decided progress in culture. In Michoacan,
to the northwest of the valley of Mexico, dwelt
the Tarascos. They spoke a totally different tongue,
but according to Aztec legend had accompanied the
Nahua from a northern region into their Mexican
homes. Physically they are described as a taller and
handsomer folk than the Nahuas, with a language
singularly vocalic and musical. Bold in war, they
were never subject to the Aztecs, and appear to have
been their equals in the arts. They constructed houses
of stone, and made use of a hieroglyphic writing to preserve
the records of their ancestors.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></p>

<p>The Mixtecs and Zapotecs were neighboring tribes,
who lived on and near the Pacific above the Isthmus
of Tehuantepec. By tradition both nations came together
from the north; “mixtecatl” in Nahuatl means
“people from the cloudy land.” To them are attributed
the remarkable edifices of Mitla, stone-built
structures, whose walls are elaborately ornamented
with rude stone mosaics in meander designs or
“grecques.” The roofs seem to have been supported
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
by solid pillars of granite, some of which are still in
place. Of the age or purposes of these buildings we
know nothing, as they were deserted and in ruins
when first visited by the Spaniards.</p>

<p>There are many smaller tribes in Mexico of independent
stocks, but a catalogue of their names would
be of little use. The most widely distributed are the
Otomis. They are of small stature, dolichocephalic,
and averse to civilization. According to tradition
they are the oldest occupants of the land, possessing
it before the arrival of the Nahuas. Their language
in singularly difficult, nasal and primitive. In form it
is almost monosyllabic, with a tendency to isolation.
This has led some writers to believe it akin to the
Chinese, for which there is not the slightest ground.</p>

<h4><i>5. The Inter-Isthmian Group.</i></h4>

<p>Between the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and that of
Panama the continent narrows to a point, and the
pressure of the population advancing from both directions
forced a large number of diverse nationalities
into a limited area. Only one of these could lay claim
to a respectable civilization, most of the others living
in primitive savagery.</p>

<p>This people, the Mayas, occupied the whole of the
peninsula of Yucatan, and the territory south of it to
the Pacific Ocean. It was divided into a number of
independent tribes, the principal of which were the
Quiches and Cakchiquels, in the present State of Guatemala.
In all there were about eighteen dialects of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
the tongue, each of which can easily be recognized
as a member of the stock.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the common ancestors
of these tribes moved down from the north, following
the shore of the Gulf of Mexico. This is the statement
of their most ancient traditions, and it is supported
by the presence of one of their tribes, the
Huastecas, on the shore of the Gulf, near Tampico.
It has been calculated that their entrance into Yucatan
was about the beginning of the Christian era.</p>

<p>Physically the Maya peoples are of medium height,
dark in hue, the skull usually long (dolichocephalic),
the nose prominent, and the muscular force superior.
The artist Waldeck compares their features to those
of the Arabs.</p>

<p>Their mental aptitudes are reflected in the culture
they developed under circumstances not the most
favorable. As architects they erected the most remarkable
monuments on the continent. The elaborate
decorations in stone, the bold carving, the free
employment of the pointed arch, and the size of the
edifices in the ancient cities of Palenque, Copan,
Uxmal, Chichen Itza, and others, place them in the
front rank among the wondrous ruins of the ancient
world.</p>

<p>They were a decidedly agricultural people, cultivating
maize, cotton, tobacco, peppers, beans, and cacao.
The land was portioned out with care, each house-holder
being granted an area in proportion to the size
of his family. The cotton was woven into cloth, skilfully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
dyed, and cut into graceful garments. The dyes
were vegetable substances, collected from the native
forests. What is not elsewhere paralleled in America,
they carried on an extensive apiculture, domesticating
the wild bee in wooden hives, and obtaining from its
stores both wax and honey.</p>

<p>Their weapons and utensils were mostly of stone.
There is no evidence that the Maya tribes had the
metallurgical skill of the Nahuas. Obsidian, jade,
agate, and chert were the materials from which they
made their tools and weapons.</p>

<p>In war and the chase they were expert with the
bow, the long lance, and the blow-pipe or sarbacane,
a device recurring in both North and South America,
as well as familiar to the Malays. The war-club, the
sling and the tomahawk or hand-axe were also known
to them.</p>

<p>Small quantities of gold, silver and copper were
found among them, but not in objects of utility. They
were prized as materials for ornaments, and were employed
for decorative purposes.</p>

<p>The art of writing was familiar to most of the
Maya tribes, and especially to those in Yucatan. The
Spanish authors assert that the Quiches in Guatemala
had written annals extending eight hundred years before
the conquest, or to 750 A. D., and the chronicles
of the Mayas which have been preserved, refer to a
still more remote past, possibly to about 300 A. D.
The script was quite dissimilar in appearance from the
Mexican.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span></p>

<p>Adjoining or near the numerous branches of the
Maya peoples, there dwelt several outliving colonies
of Nahuas in the Isthmian region, who have left there
interesting relics of their culture. The Pipiles near
the Pacific coast were the authors of a series of excellent
bas-reliefs carved on slabs of stone, which have
recently come into the possession of the Berlin museum.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a>
The Nicaraos, between the Pacific Ocean and
Lake Nicaragua, and on the islands in this lake, were
the sculptors of the strange figures in stone pictured
by Squier in his travels, and some of which are now
in the Smithsonian museum; while the Alaguilacs in
Western Guatemala have left ruins which have not yet
been explored.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> All these tribes were Nahuas of pure
blood.</p>

<p>On the shores of Lake Managua, to the east and
west, were the Mangues, a people of some cultivation,
acquainted with a form of hieroglyphic or picture
writing, very skilful in pottery, and agricultural in
habits.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> It has been ascertained that they are a branch
of the Chapanecs, who dwelt in the province of
Chiapas, Mexico.</p>

<p>The other tribes around Lake Nicaragua were wild.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
The Woolwas on the north, and the Huatusos along
the Rio Frio to the east, depended on hunting and
fishing for a livelihood. So also did most of the tribes
of Honduras, Vera Paz and the Isthmus. The only
nation which distinguished itself in the arts were the
Cuevas, in and around Chiriqui Bay. They were
adroit in the treatment of gold. The early writers
describe them as prominent in general culture and
certain technical arts. To them we attribute the gold
figures disinterred from the mounds of Chiriqui and
its neighborhood. They are manufactured by two
methods, the one by soldering gold wires drawn out
into the finest thread upon thin hammered plates of
the same metal, the wire forming the design; the other
by casting hollow figures.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> The skill displayed often
excites the astonishment of the jewellers of our own
day.</p>

<h4><i>6. The South Atlantic Group.</i></h4>

<p>The interminable forests of Brazil and the endless
plains of the Pampas were at the discovery thickly
peopled by bands of roving nations, dependent chiefly
on the products of woods and streams for their support.
None of them had sedentary dwellings, none
knew the art of building with brick or stone, and none
laid much stress on agriculture. Some of them had,
however, considerable technical skill in various directions,
and few if any of them could be assigned to as
low a status as the Australians, for example.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>The ruling people on the northern coast and the
Lesser Antilles at that time were the <i>Caribs</i>. They
possessed much of the coast line from the Isthmus
of Panama to the mouth of the Orinoco, and many of
the smaller southern islands of the West Indian archipelago.
They had established a colony on Hayti, but
probably not on Cuba, and their expeditions, so far as
we know, never reached Florida. According to their
own statements, all the island Caribs came from the
mainland at no long period before the Discovery. Recent
researches have shown that the original home of
the stock was south of the Amazon, and probably in
the highlands at the head of the Tapajoz River. A
tribe, the Bakairi, is still resident there, whose language
is a pure and archaic form of the Carib tongue.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<p>They were a finely formed set of men, the skull long
but variable, their color dark, large narrow nose, prominent
cheek bones, wide mouth, and thin lips.</p>

<p>Their language is rich in vowels and pleasant to the
ear. In some districts that spoken by the women varied
in some degree from that in use among the men.
This is not without other examples among the American
race, and appears to have arisen partly from the
custom of capturing women from other tribes for
wives, partly from a tendency to easy dialectic variation
in the languages themselves.</p>

<p>The <i>Arawaks</i> occupied on the continent the area of
the modern Guiana, between the Corentyn and the
Pomeroon rivers, and at one time all the West Indian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
Islands. From some of them they were early driven
by the Caribs, and within forty year of the date of
Columbus’ first voyage the Spanish had exterminated
nearly all on the islands. Their course of migration
had been from the interior of Brazil northward; their
distant relations are still to be found between the
headwaters of the Paraguay and Schingu rivers.</p>

<p>The extensive slope which is watered by the Amazon
and its tributaries is peopled by numerous tribes
whose affinities are obscure. Those on the plains near
the coast belonged to the <i>Tupi-Guarani</i> stock. This
extended along the Atlantic from Rio de la Plata
to the Amazon, embracing in the north the Tupis or
Tupinambas, and on the south the Guaranis. Scattered
tribes of the stock extended westward to the
Paraguay and Madeira rivers, reaching to the foot
hills of Andes. Though positive data are lacking
about their early migrations, the evidence at hand
tends to show that these were from south to north, and
that the Tupis displaced an earlier people of a different
physical type and a lower grade of culture.</p>

<p>This is the result derived both from a comparison of
existing dialects and from explorations in the artificial
shell-heaps, or <i>sambaquis</i>, which are found along the
coast. Many of them are of great size and very ancient.
They contain skulls of an inferior type, with
low foreheads, prominent and strong jaws, and short
skulls (brachycephalic), while the Tupi skull is more
fully developed and long (dolichocephalic). Similar
shell-heaps, proving an equally rude people, are found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
along the coast of Guinea, and both among the Arawaks
of that locality, and still more among the Goajiros
of the peninsula of that name on the coast of
Venezuela, who are distantly related to the Arawaks,
do we find the brachycephalic skull and strong jaws of
the builders of the “sambaquis.” We may suppose,
therefore, that the Tupis drove these earlier residents
to the shores of the northern ocean.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<p>In frequent contiguity with the Tupis was another
stock, also widely dispersed through Brazil, called the
<i>Tapuyas</i>, of whom the Botocudos in eastern Brazil are
the most prominent tribe. To them also belong the
Ges nations, south of the lower Amazon, and others.
They are on a low grade of culture, going quite naked,
not cultivating the soil, ignorant of pottery, and with
poorly made canoes. They are dolichocephalic, and
must have inhabited the country for a long time, as the
skulls found in the caves at Lagoa Santa, in connection
with the bones of extinct animals, are identical in
form with those of the Botocudos, and probably belonged
to their ancestors.</p>

<p>West of the Paraguay River is an extensive plain
called El Gran Chaco, beginning at the eighteenth degree
of south latitude, and continuing to the Pampas
of Buenos Ayres. This region was peopled by numerous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
wandering tribes, the Abipones, the Guaycurus,
the Lules, and scores of others. They were in
nowise related to the Guaranis, having short skulls,
different linguistic stocks, and an inferior grade of
culture. As they were warlike, and in constant strife
with the whites, as well as among themselves, they
have now nearly disappeared.</p>

<p>The tribes of the Pampas were on a similar plane of
development, and have also given way before the
march of the white race.</p>

<p>In the extreme south of the continent are the Patagonians
and Fuegians. The former are sometimes
called Tehuelches, or Southerners. They are a nomadic
and hunting people, dark olive-brown in color,
tall in stature and robust.</p>

<p>The Fuegians are generally quoted as among the
most miserable of savages. Though exposed to a
damp and cold climate and always insufficiently nourished,
they wear scarcely any clothing, and are content
with wretched huts of branches and weeds. They
have long skulls (about 75), long, narrow eyes, well-shaped
noses, and generally are good specimens of
one of the American types. Their language is eminently
polysynthetic and rich in terms to express the
objects and incidents of their daily life.</p>

<h4><i>7. The South Pacific Group.</i></h4>

<p>The principal nations in the South Pacific group
are the Chibchas and the Qquichuas.</p>

<p>The former, called also Muyscas, resided near the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
Magdalena River, near the present city of Bogota.
They were sedentary, agricultural, and skilful in a
number of arts. Their agriculture extended to maize,
potatoes, cotton, yucca and other vegetables, and their
fields were irrigated by canals. As potters and goldsmiths
they ranked among the finest on the continent,
and both for symmetry of form and richness of decoration
some of the vases from their district cannot be
surpassed from American products.</p>

<p>The most powerful and cultivated of the South
American nations were the Qquichuas of Peru. Originally
they were a small tribe near Lake Titicaca,
where they dwelt in close relations to the Aymaras.
About 1000 A. D., their chief, Manco Capac, conquered
the valleys to the north and founded the city
of Cuzco. His successors added to the territory of
the state until it extended from a few degrees north of
the equator to about 20° south latitude, or a distance
along the coast of over 1500 miles. In width it
varied from 200 to 400 miles. Of course it embraced
a variety of distinct stocks, so that it is impossible to
speak of any “Peruvian” type of skull or features,
the less so as it was the policy of the Incas, as the
rulers were called, to remove conquered tribes to distant
parts of the realm.</p>

<p>The social organization of Peru rested upon the
political union of clans or gentes, as it did in most other
American nations. The ruler of the realm acted in
accordance with the advice of the council elected by
the gentes, but also exercised at times an autocratic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
power, and it would be an error to consider him not
more independent than the war-chief of one of the
hunting tribes. The office was hereditary in the
female line, provided a satisfactory candidate appeared;
otherwise it was elective.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p>

<p>No American nation surpassed the Peruvians in
agricultural arts. Maize, cotton, coca, potatoes, and
tobacco were the principal crops. As the arable land
in the narrow vales of their country was limited, they
increased its extent by constructing terraces along the
mountain sides, and to guard against the aridity, numerous
dams were built, from which canals carried the
water for miles to the various fields. Fertilizers were
dug into the soil, and a rotation of crops observed to
prevent its exhaustion. The domestication of animals
had advanced further in Peru than elsewhere on the
continent. Besides the dog, and a fowl like a goose,
they had large herds of lamas, an animal they used
for food and also for carrying burdens, though its
chief value was its wool. This was spun and woven
into articles of clothing, mats, etc. Quantities of cloth
from this substance and from cotton are exhumed
from the ancient tombs. The specimens are often in
good preservation, showing geometrical designs
worked with symmetry, and dyed of various bright
colors.</p>

<p>In the mountain regions the houses were generally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
of stone, and in the arid coast lands, of sun-dried
bricks. They were located in groups surrounded by
walls, also of stone or brick. The stones were sometimes
fitted together with extraordinary nicety, or elsewhere
were united with mortar or cement. Recent
travellers have stated that the stone-work on some of
the ruins of the Inca palaces is equal to that in any
part of the world; this is especially true of the mysterious
ruins of Tiahuanaco, near Lake Titicaca, where
some of the most complete work on the continent is
to be found.</p>

<p>These architects had not discovered the pointed
arch, as had the Mayas, and in the details of their
structures, as in the forms of their doors and the perfect
simplicity of their walls, it is clearly seen that they
had no connection with the northern civilizations.
The structures were rarely erected on pyramids or
mounds, and frequently were of several stories in
height.</p>

<p>Their skill in the reduction and manufacture of various
metals excited the admiration of the Europeans.
Among the articles they offered the Spaniards were
utensils, both solid and hollow, of gold, imitations of
fruits and animals of the same substance, golden butterflies,
idols, birds, masks, and mace-heads. Groups
of half a dozen figures in various attitudes have been
found of solid silver, the symmetry and expression
being well preserved.</p>

<p>There was a like exuberance in the forms they gave
their pottery. The jars and vases were imitations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
of every kind of object around them&mdash;fish, birds, reptiles,
fruits, men, houses. Often the product is so
symmetrical that one is tempted to believe it was
formed by a potter’s wheel; but this invention, so ancient
in the old world, was never known to the American
Race. Curious ingenuity is displayed in the production
of whistling or musical jars, which will emit a
note when the fluid is poured in; or trick-jars, which
cannot be emptied unless turned in a certain direction,
not at first obvious. The art of glazing was not
known, and most of the pottery seems to have been
sun-dried only.</p>

<p>With the materialistic notions of religion and of a
future life which they entertained, it was regarded of
the utmost importance that the body should be preserved
undisturbed in the tomb. Hence it was often
carefully mummified, and the sepulchres were selected
in the most secret and inaccesible location, either a
cave on the side of a precipice, or if in the plains the
grave was levelled, so that no sign of it appeared on
the surface.</p>

<p>South of the Peruvian monarchy were the Araucanians,
occupying the area of the modern state of
Chili. They were a warlike, hunting race, physically and
also linguistically akin to the tribes of the Pampas.
Neither the Incas nor the Spaniards succeeded in reducing
their indomitable spirit. In culture they had
gained an advantage over the Pampean tribes by their
relations to the Qquichuas, but were far behind the
latter in general aptitude in the arts. Much of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
subsistence was dependent on the chase, and they are
not classed among the partly civilized natives of the
continent. They are described as tall and robust, the
skull brachycephalic, the face round, the nose short
and rather flattened.

<p>Relation of ethnography to historical and political science.</p></blockquote>

<p>The population of the world in this year of 1890
is estimated at over fifteen hundred millions. This
vast multitude have passed in review before us in
their races, peoples and nations. What is the future
of these jostling millions, each individual of whom is
striving after some goal, seeking to satisfy some
desire?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>

<p>This momentous question depends directly on the
solution of certain problems with which the ethnographer
especially has to deal. On the right reading
of these problems rests the destiny of races, and on
the destiny of races hangs the fate of Man. We shall
do well therefore to take home from the study of this
science the horoscope it forecasts.</p>

<p>The first of these inquiries is</p>

<h4><i>The Problem of Acclimation.</i></h4>

<p>How far can the various races not merely support
and live through, but do good work in the varied climates
of the world?</p>

<p>Never was this question so urgent as to-day. With
fleets of steamships ploughing every ocean, and the
iron horse racing on its steel track over every continent,
the movement of men is conducted in such masses
and with such rapidity that the most extensive migrations
of nations of other ages seem insignificant in
comparison.</p>

<p>Like many other questions in ethnography, this one
has been answered very variously, too often, evidently,
by writers influenced by other motives than a single
desire to reach the truth. It has been in close proximity
to political and social movements, and facts have
been twisted to serve the purposes of advocates.</p>

<p>The facts, indeed, are easily liable to misinterpretation.
Take the white race, for instance. It has for
centuries possessed flourishing colonies not only in the
southern temperate zone, which would not surprise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
us, but under the torrid suns of India, Mexico and
Brazil, in Java and the Isle of France, in the West and
East Indies, not to speak of the Hamitic tribes, who
thousands of years ago established themselves on the
borders of the Sudan (see above, p. 116). Long before
that, the Indo-Aryans had crossed the Hindu
Kush and extended their sway over the Dravidian
peoples of Hindostan.</p>

<p>But in these tropical regions have they not merely
existed, but also prospered? Have they retained,
along with the purity of their blood, also their fecundity,
their viability and their energy? I must reply
emphatically, No. In the words of a medical observer
of ample experience in the tropics&mdash;“The changes
which a torrid climate impresses upon the constitution
of Europeans and upon their descendants are pathological,
and tend with fatal certainty to the extinction
of the race.”<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> In India the children of English
parents must be sent back to Great Britain or they will
perish. It is said that in the history of the civil service
there has not been a single family which survived
three generations. Even the first generation loses the
energy which characterizes the parental stock. The
whites nowhere in the tropics can undergo continuous
physical toil exposed to the sun. They are always
found subsisting on the labor of the native races.</p>

<p>The Spanish and Portuguese population of tropical
America have survived in their new home for nearly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
four hundred years. But when have they displayed
the astonishing energy of the early <i>Conquistadores</i>?
Many of the so-called Spanish creoles are really of
mixed blood. In Peru and Mexico it is hard to find a
family without the strain of another race in its pedigree.
In Cuba, where there has been the least exposure
to this result, owing to the prompt extinction of
the natives, the descendants of the early European immigrants
are enfeebled and infertile. While in Mexico,
in Guatemala, and in Yucatan, the men of prominent
energy are either of mixed blood or, like the late Governor
Barrios, are of the once conquered, the pure
American race. I do not call a race acclimated which
merely manages to exist, at the sacrifice of those qualities
which are its highest claim to distinction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the black race finds it hopeless
to struggle with the climate above the fortieth parallel
of latitude. In no portion of Southern Europe did it
ever maintain itself, and when its members were carried
in numbers as slaves to Mauritius and Ceylon,
they succumbed to the change.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> Even in Africa it is
doubtful if it ever effected a permanent settlement on
the shores of the Mediterranean. Pulmonary diseases
and scrofula are the chief morbid changes which destroy
its emigrants.</p>

<p>In the West Indies and generally in tropical and
sub-tropical America they seem to flourish. In the
United States the “colored people” increase by birth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
more rapidly in proportion than the whites, though
this calculation includes the mulattoes and others of
mixed blood.</p>

<p>Whether the Asian race has greater or less powers
of acclimation than others is a question of much significance
at present, when the teeming millions of the Celestial
empire seem ready to pour forth in resistless
floods over the whole earth. We are not prepared to
reply. The subjection of this race to foreign climatic
influences has been too recent and under conditions too
exceptional to furnish the requisite data; and in their
own land, the Chinese, from whom we look for the
most portentous migrations, have lived in a country
which does not present contrasts equal to those of the
various zones.</p>

<p>The American race may be regarded as an exception
to the others. The area it always occupied extended
from one polar circle to the other, including
every degree of altitude, and every extreme of temperature
to which man is exposed. No difference in the
viability or the energy of its members in various parts
of the continent can be noted. The most remarkable
monuments of its toilsome industry were completed
under the tropical sun of Yucatan; while one of the
most ingenious of its tribes lived the farthest north of
any human beings. The physical energy of the stalwart
Patagonian is not superior to that of the active
Carib or the northern Algonkin. We may possibly
find the explanation of this in the trend of the chief
mountains and rivers of the continent, which facilitated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
easy progress from north to south, while in the eastern
hemisphere the trend running parallel with the latitude,
separated the early peoples into smaller climatic areas.</p>

<p>While the facts so far as ascertained seem to point
to the decision that each race is confined to climatic
conditions similar to that of its original area of characterization,
the theory has been advanced that this is
but for a time, that by persistence and repeated sacrifices
of the unfit, finally a remnant will survive fully
able to face the novel trials of the climatic change.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p>This, however, is a theory only. It may be allowed
credence to the extent that the survival of a remnant
is possible; but it would be at the sacrifice of the distinctive
qualities of the higher races; those can flourish
only under the physical conditions which gave them
birth.</p>

<p>It has also been urged that the improved sanitary
hygienic science of modern times will do efficient battle
against the lethal influences of strange climes.
Doubtless in individual cases such precautions are of
the highest value; they aid the system in withstanding
malarial and zymotic poisons; but the best of them,
employed on the widest scale, will prove sadly inadequate,
as is shown by their failure in many a tract in
the temperate zone. If we cannot restore salubrity to
the Roman Campagna, or to Staten Island in New
York Harbor, it is more than wild to talk of rendering
healthful the Congo Basin.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>

<p>I am tempted, therefore, to consider this problem
of acclimation insoluble, and to express myself in the
words of the learned physician I have already quoted,
“There is no such thing as acclimation. A race never
was acclimated, and in the present condition of the
world, a race never can become acclimated.”<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></p>

<p>The second of our inquiries relates to</p>

<h4><i>The Problem of Amalgamation</i></h4>

<p>&mdash;that which the French call <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métissage</i> and the Americans
<i>miscegenation</i>. The fact that we have manufactured
this “recent and ill-formed word,” as Webster’s
<i>Unabridged</i> calls it, is evidence that the questions involved
in this problem touch us nearly. They touch
the whole world, and very closely. I know of nothing
within the range of human power to control, more
decisive of the future prosperity or failure of the
human species than this of the effect of race-intermarriage.</p>

<p>The consequences of such blendings may be studied
with reference to the viability of the offspring, their
mental faculties, and their fecundity.</p>

<p>At the outset it is important to premise that the
question cannot be treated as simple and single. It is
complex. The results of race-crossings differ with
races and with evironment. The law that applies to
one case in one place is not certainly good in other
cases and elsewhere.</p>

<p>It seems, for instance, tolerably certain that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
cross between the white and black races produces
offspring (mulattoes) who are deficient in physical
vigor. It is well ascertained in the United States
that they are peculiarly prone to scrofula and consumption,
unable to bear hard work, and shorter lived
than either the full black or the white. This is not
owing to our climate, as the same results are recognized
by the negroes of the Gold Coast, who for four
hundred years have been in constant contact with the
whites.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> In the West India Islands, the mulattoes
must be constantly reinforced by new crossings, or
they disappear.</p>

<p>The fertility of such unions, though generally equal
if the number of births alone is considered, is really
less on account of the greater mortality of the infants.
As a rule, the third generation of descendants of a
marriage between the white and the Polynesian, Australian
or Dravidian, become extinct through short
lives, feeble constitutions or sterility. According to
one writer, except a few small islands in the Pacific,
there is not an instance of a modern population of
mixed white blood, living by itself, which is not on
the road to extinction.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p>It is not certain that this applies either to the crossing
of the Eurafrican or the African with the American
race. The half-breed between the negro and the
Indian, of which we have examples in the Cafusos of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
Brazil, the Zambos of Paraguay, the Chinos of Peru,
and the “Black Caribs” of St. Vincent, are said to be
finely formed and vigorous. Throughout Mexico,
Central and South America, there has been a blending
of the white and red races on an enormous scale, and
the result has been that both physically and mentally
this mixed race has repeatedly taken precedence in
political and social life over the pure descendants of
the European colonists. It is well-known that the
half-breeds of our frontiers, of British America and of
Greenland, are singularly hardy, intelligent and vigorous
scouts, guides, hunters and soldiers. Not a few
of them have distinguished themselves in our colleges,
and later in clerical and political life.</p>

<p>It would appear also that in the earlier conditions
of social life, no such debility attended the crossing of
the Eurafrican and African race as seems at present to
be the case. The only physiological explanation which
can be offered of the numerous negroid tribes of
eastern and southern Africa, is that they are the descendants
of prolonged and intimate unions between
the pure negroes and members of the Hamitic and
Semitic divisions of the white race (see above, p. 185).
This permits the suggestion that there are special
causes now at work which alter the influences of race-mixture
from what they once were.</p>

<p>Some of them are patent. In modern times it is an
almost universal law that all mixed-white populations
derive their white blood exclusively from the father,
their dark blood exclusively from the mother. I do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
not know that I can tell you precisely what effect this
would have,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> but it is certain that such a divergence
from what is customary within the race limits would
exert a decided influence both physically and socially.
It is generally believed among students of heredity
that the psychical qualities are inherited more from
the mother, the physical more from the father; and if
this holds good in most cases, we should expect the
children of such unions to be intellectually inferior to
the average of their parents. This I think is true.
Advocates of miscegenation, such as de Quatrefages,
Serres and others, are apt to draw a different conclusion,
because they compare the average intellectual
ability of the products of such unions with the average
of the lower race, and this is certainly in favor of the
mixed stock, but is an unscientific procedure.</p>

<p>It is also true that in perhaps ninety per cent. of the
cases, these mixed unions are illegal, and the children
suffer under the stigma of illegitimacy. This means
more or less deficiency in home training, education,
legal protection, and social recognition. In primitive
conditions this was not the case, and hence race
minglings at that time were under far more favorable
auspices.</p>

<p>In most modern communities the prejudice against
members or partial members of the dark races forces
them to rest content with unequal advantages, if not
educational, at least social, and the recognition of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
these invisible barriers must necessarily have a deteriorating
influence on ambition. This of course was
not the case in primitive society, where no other power
was recognized than that of the strong right arm.</p>

<p>The possibility of a vigorous and fertile cross-race
under certain conditions seems therefore to have been
demonstrated by the past history of the species. Is it
a desirable result in itself? May we look forward to
the commingling of races as worth the fostering care
of states and societies? The question bristles with
difficulties&mdash;moral, not physical difficulties.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt but that any white mixed
race is lower in the scale of intelligence than the pure
white race. A white man entails indelible degradation
on his descendants who takes in marriage a woman of
a darker race; and any relation other than that of
marriage, no matter if it does lift the lower race, is
unauthorized by any sound moral code. Still more to
be deplored is the woman of the white race who unites
herself with a man of a lower ethnic type. It cannot
be too often repeated, too emphatically urged, that it
is to the women alone of the highest race that we
must look to preserve the purity of the type, and with
it the claims of the race to be the highest. They have
no holier duty, no more sacred mission, than that of
transmitting in its integrity the heritage of ethnic endowment
gained by the race through thousands of
generations of struggle. That philanthropy is false,
that religion is rotten, which would sanction a white
woman enduring the embrace of a colored man.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p>The two problems we have now discussed seem to
present a dilemma. The pure races do not flourish
out of their physiological surroundings; and yet some
of them are not adequate for the work required by
modern culture. What resource have we? The answer
is, in the union of the lower races among themselves,
especially the Mongolian and the African.
Thus we may expect a blending capable of resisting
the heat of the tropics, and intelligent enough to carry
out the directions of that race which will ever and
everywhere maintain its supremacy so long as it
maintains its ethnic purity&mdash;the Eurafrican.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to</p>

<h4><i>The Problem of Civilization.</i></h4>

<p>It is one which has arisen within the last two or
three centuries, and is now so urgent that it will have
an instant reply. With increased means of locomotion
and augmented love of progress, civilization is
now transported, with all its complex forces, to every
nation and every tribe, no matter where or of what
race, and the question is put point blank, Will you accept
this precious gift, or will you have it forced upon
you, with such results as may happen? Japan has
welcomed the message, inscrutable China hesitates,
Persia wavers, the miserable Australians refuse, the
savages turn their back&mdash;all in vain; the message is
importunate, will take no denial, must be accepted.
Opposition means destruction. The Bechuana kraal
which refuses to have a grand opera house and electric
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
lights, if the European sees fit to put them there, will
be wiped out of existence. So will every tribe, every
nation, every race, which sets forth to oppose the resistless
flow of civilized progress.</p>

<p>Preservation, however, and not destruction, is the
maxim of the ripest culture. The Tasmanian is extinct,
the Polynesian disappearing, many an American
tribe lives only in name, all gone down before the
fierce flames of a civilization which did not lighten,
but consumed them. Many another people is disappearing
in the same way, in spite of the devoted efforts
of earnest men and women to save them, to bring
them into accord with the thought of the higher race,
to teach them the boundless blessings of European
enlightenment.</p>

<p>What is the history of these efforts? Failure, and
yet again failure. Consider the history of the attempts
to bring the American race into accord with the
European. There were the noble endeavors of the
Jesuits in Paraguay, the untiring zeal of the Franciscans
in Yucatan, the admirable devotion of the Moravian
brethren in the northern continent, and the long
list of missionary societies in Protestant churches.
These represent the most sustained, unselfish and
enlightened efforts which have ever been made to
civilize the Indians. They are of the same nature
and on the same plan as those which have been and
still are directed toward other savage peoples, the
Polynesians and Africans for example.</p>

<p>Have they been successful? Can an instance be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
adduced where they have achieved a full and permanent
introduction of a savage tribe to the real benefits
of our civilization?</p>

<p>I cannot answer for the history of missions throughout
the world, but I can and do for my special field,
America, and I say, not a single instance of success
can be named. The Jesuits and the Moravians succeeded,
indeed, in reclaiming the natives from their
wild life; they transformed them from warring savages
into peaceful planters; from drunken, cruel and superstitious,
they made them sober, kind and religious.
This was a noble, an admirable result. But were their
converts any the more able to accept the civilization of
Europe? Not a whit. David Zeisberger’s last sermon
was a wail that his sixty years’ of missionary work had
failed to accomplish this result. Ten years after the
expulsion of the Jesuits from Paraguay, their extensive
“reductions,” which at one time included thirty or
forty thousand Christianized natives, were a heap of
ruins, and the converts dispersed to the four winds&mdash;and
this after nearly two centuries of training!</p>

<p>Should we conclude from these sad histories that it
is impossible to bring the existing savage nations into
accord with our own culture? This is not my conclusion.
Rather I infer that we have not tried the proper
measures. We have relied almost exclusively on missionary
religious work, forgetting that our religion is
only one part of our civilization, and, so far as it is
dogmatic and ceremonial, much the least part. We
have been singularly inconsequent. We send our own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
children six days to a secular school, and only on the
seventh to a Sunday-school; but the poor Indian we
send to Sunday-school all seven days, and then expect
him to have an education like our own! Our missionaries
hold up to the savage pictures of Christian
brotherhood, of unselfish motive, of universal charity,
which he soon finds have no existence in Christian
communities or modern civilization. If he is an honest
convert, he is absolutely disqualified from contact
with civilized peoples! The Jesuits and the Moravians,
both practical orders, knew this well, and therefore not
only prevented their acolytes learning European
tongues, but used every means at their command to
banish all relations between the two races in those
under their control.</p>

<p>It may seem uncharitable in me to oppose and condemn
missionary enterprises in savage communities;
but I do so under the full conviction that as usually
conducted they fail, and are bound to fail, in the most
excellent aim they have in view. To succeed, they
should be combined with a broad secular education,
with a full recognition of the real impulses of modern
life, and an effort to inculcate sound principles rather
than respect for ceremonies and dogmas, about which
the Christian sects themselves are never in unison.
The native religious and moral codes should be
studied, and all that is good in them&mdash;generally there
is a great deal of good&mdash;should be retained; right actions
should be based on respect for law, on the inherent
sense of justice, on natural affection, and not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
merely on ecclesiastical edicts. Above all, independence
of thought should be encouraged, the principles
of religious and political freedom should be held up as
superior to those of subjection, and the convert should
be instructed that attachment to any particular creed is
in no wise requisite to enjoy the best results of civilization.</p>

<p>It may be objected that doctrines such as these
would leave the missionary as such little to teach. I
reply that these doctrines are true, and are those necessary
to the reception of civilization, and if they are
omitted or obscured, the missionary is not an apostle
of light, but of darkness, and that his efforts will
prove unsuccessful in the future, as they have in the
past.</p>

<p>The consideration of this problem of civilization
leads us to cast a glance at the future and to ponder
on</p>

<h4><i>The Destiny of Races.</i></h4>

<p>We are well aware that many a family, many a
tribe, many a linguistic stock, has perished off the face
of the earth, leaving no trace of its existence. Of
others we know but the “naked nominations.” May
not whole races have followed the same fatal course?
Nay, more, may not some of the existing races be
likewise doomed, as the mature tree, to fall and disappear?</p>

<p>It was the opinion of the learned Broca that certain
osseous remains in Europe point to a race once there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
entirely unlike any other, modern or ancient.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> The
gloomy precedent is established, therefore, and we
have to reflect if it applies to any now living varieties
of our species.</p>

<p>Beginning at home, we may first inquire concerning
the American race. The question, Are the Indians
dying out? was investigated some years ago by
learned authorities at Washington, who announced the
cheerful result that, contrary to the universal opinion,
the red man is not decreasing at all, but increasing in
numbers!<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<p>I have studied these pleasing statements with care,
and regret that I do not reach the same satisfactory
conclusions. The writers in question take no account
of the signs of a dense ancient population in the Ohio
valley, in Michigan, in Florida, in the Pueblo region;
they take for granted that the estimates of all the early
voyagers and travelers were gross exaggerations; they
pay no attention to the historic fact that the natives of
the Atlantic coast suffered severely from epidemic
diseases before the English established their first settlements,
diseases probably disseminated from the
Spanish colonies in Florida or Mexico; finally, they
commit the fatal ethnographic error of confounding
under the name “Indians” both the pure and the
mixed members of the race.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span></p>

<p>This last oversight vitiates all the argument. No
one is prepared to say that some faint strain of native
American blood may not be perpetuated indefinitely.
But this is not the survival of the race or of the “Indians,”
any more than the Normans survive to-day in
England.</p>

<p>My own studies convince me that the American
race is and has long been disappearing, both actually,
tribe by tribe, and relatively, by admixture with the
whites. In our own area there were many tribes
once of considerable numbers, who have become
wholly extinct. The Timucuas of Florida, the Catawbas
of South Carolina, the Monacans of Virginia,
the Mohegans of New York, the Boethucs of Newfoundland,
have no living representatives. The whole
of the inhabitants of the Bahamas and Greater Antilles
were hurried to destruction in a couple of generations
after the discovery by Columbus. The list would be
long were I to recapitulate the dead languages known
by name or by a few sentences in some old missionary
book, to the student of American linguistics.</p>

<p>The process is not suspended. Beginning at the
north with the Eskimos, we find their number steadily
diminishing;<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> the Athabascas, according to Petitot,
are but a wreck of their former selves; of the tribes of
the United States, Miss Alice Fletcher, who has traveled
extensively among them, assures me that in a few
generations there will be scarcely any of pure descent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
surviving; and I have noted for myself on the reservations
what an increasing proportion of the young people
reveal the infusion of European blood.</p>

<p>The same is true all over the Continent. The
American Indian, as such, is destined to disappear
before European civilization. If he retains his habits
he will be exterminated; if he aims to preserve an unmixed
descent, he will be crushed out by disease and
competition; his only resource is to blend his race with
the whites, and this infallibly means his disappearance
from the scene.</p>

<p>The Island World, extending from Easter Island to
Madagascar, presents the same spectacle. The aboriginal,
undersized Negritos have long disappeared
from many of the larger islands where they lived in
historic times; and on the Philippines and elsewhere
the report is that they are slowly but steadily drifting
toward annihilation.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> The Tasmanians have perished
to the last man; the Australians are one-fifth what
they were estimated by the best authorities at the beginning
of the century; the Maoris of New Zealand
have lessened one-half; the natives of Easter Island
have sunk from twenty-five hundred in 1850 to less
than three hundred; and so on for nearly all the
Polynesian islands.</p>

<p>This extreme fatality has received the earnest attention
of philanthropists and scientific physicians.
Its causes are visible. They are the introduction of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
new epidemics, as measles, small-pox, syphilis and
consumption, the last mentioned peculiarly fatal, and
now recognized as eminently contagious under certain
conditions; an increased infant mortality; drunkenness
and its consequences; and diminished fecundity in
the women. This last is both one of the most potent
and one of the obscurest of the causes of diminished
population. Why at some certain period a people
should be smitten with sterility is a mysterious fact,
for which the explanation must be postponed until we
become better acquainted with the many enigmas
which surround the process of reproduction.</p>

<p>Add to the death-rate the considerable percentage
of children who are born of unions with the White,
the Asian or the African races, and are thus no longer
representatives of the ancestral stock, and we must
acknowledge that these insular peoples are in no
better, even a worse case than the American Indians.
They, too, are sitting beneath the Damocles sword of
extinction.</p>

<p>Such an assertion is doubtfully applicable to the
Austafrican race. I have already referred to some
statistics showing its heavy mortality in the isles of
France and Ceylon, and the German ethnographer
Ratzel is inclined to believe that it is diminishing in
Central Africa itself.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> But the census returns of our
own country and of the West Indies show a positive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
and rapid increase particularly if we include the large
population of mixed blood.</p>

<p>We have been taught in this country to look with
something like terror on the teeming millions of China,
only awaiting the chance to overrun the whole earth,
underbid all other laborers, profit by the fruits of our
more liberal governments and nobler religions, and
give nothing in return. A few centuries ago a still
more dreadful fear haunted the nations of Europe
that some other Timurlane or Genghis Khan would
lead his countless hordes of merciless Mongolians
from the steppes of Siberia across the cultivated fields
of the Danube to wipe out, as with a sponge, the glorious
picture of renascent European culture.</p>

<p>The latter fear no longer disturbs any mind. The
mightiest of the Tartar powers is but a shadow, maintained
by the mutual jealousy of Europeans themselves;
the illimitable steppes of Tartary and Mongolia
acknowledge the suzerainty of the Slavonian; and the
nomadic hordes of the steppes and tundras are steadily
diminishing under the same baneful influences of
civilization which are blighting the Australian and the
American.</p>

<p>Whether this is true also of the Sinitic stocks, especially
of the Chinese, we have no positive information.
It has been rumored that of late years repeated periods
of drought, resulting in disastrous famine, have materially
reduced the population of the interior of China,
many perishing and others removing nearer the coast.
As it is only near the coast that foreigners have the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
opportunity to observe the people, it is likely that they
bring away an exaggerated notion of the density of
population in the country at large. It is at any rate
doubtful if the Chinese are more than stationary.</p>

<p>Widely different is the vista which appears before us
when we contemplate the Eurafrican race. It goes
forth conquering and to conquer, extending its empire
over all continents and to the remotest islands of the
sea. Never has that progress been so rapid as to-day.
Two centuries ago the whole of the white race which
could lay claim to purity of blood numbered not over
one hundred millions, or ten per cent. of the population
of the world, and was confined to the limits of Europe
and North Africa; now the European branch of it
alone counts nearly five hundred millions, or one-third
of the whole. In the year 1800, the non-resident
whites of European descent were ten millions; now
they are over eighty millions. Every navy and every
army of any fighting capacity belong to the European
whites and their descendants. No nation and no race
of other lineage dare withstand an attack or disobey
an order from a leading European power. Africa and
Asia are dismembered and parceled out at London,
Berlin and St. Petersburg, and no one dreams of asking
the consent of the inhabitants of those continents.</p>

<p>This astonishing progress is not due alone to the
North Mediterranean branch of the Eurafrican race.
The representatives of the South Mediterranean branch
are for a large part in it. In the forefront of it,
whether in the great capitals of Europe or in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
pioneer towns of the frontiers, we find the acute and
versatile Semite, full of energy and knowledge, guiding
in councils, his master hand on the levers of the vastest
financial schemes, his subtle policy governing the
diplomacy of statesmen and the decisions of directors.
As Prof. Gerland has well said, there is something in
the Semitic character which is complementary to that
of the Aryan,<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> and it is not without significance that
the surprising development of the latter began when
the religious prejudices against the Jews commenced
to yield to more enlightened sentiments. They are
now the growing people. Statistics show that in
Europe, while the Aryac population doubles in number
in thirty-four years, the Semites double in twenty-five
years, having more children to a marriage and
less infantile mortality.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> When bigotry ceases on
both sides, and free inter-marriage restores the Aryo-Semitic
stock to its original unity, we may look for a
race of nobler capacities than any now existing.</p>

<p>Still more rapid would that progress be, still more
beneficent would be the sway of European civilization,
could the great powers of that continent lay aside unworthy
jealousies, and agree to extend in harmony the
blessings of just government and sound education over
other races. An unreasoning distrust has prevented
the removal of the barbaric Sibiric power which
centers at Constantinople; and the excellent results of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
the extension of the Slavonian supremacy in Central
Asia have been studiously ignored by British writers.</p>

<p>Reflections such as these teach us how closely the
study of ethnographic science is related to practical
politics. Ethnography, indeed, is the necessary basis
of correct history and sound statesmanship. It offers
to history a foundation on natural law; it explains
events by showing their dependence on the physical
structure, the mental pecularities, and the geographic
surroundings of the peoples engaged in them; it presents,
in its present pictures of savage life, the condition
of the highest nations in the earlier stages of their
culture.</p>

<p>To the statesman it offers those facts about the capacities
and limitations of peoples which should guide
his dealings with them; it comes with no vague theory
of optimism or pessimism, such as doctrinaire philosophers
love to air, but with the admonition that
each people, each race, must be studied by itself, free
from bias, free from bigotry, and with the conviction
that no matter what metaphysics say, any nation, as
any man, may lift itself by the recognition of those
indefeasible and universal elements of the mind, the
“I,” the “ought,” and the “can”&mdash;the reverence of
self, the respect for duty, and the devotion to freedom.</p>

The cranial indices on one of these islands varied from 70 to 83.
The excessive claims of craniometry have been severely but justly
rebuked by Moriz Wagner, in his thoughtful work, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Entstehung
der Arten durch räumliche Sonderung</cite>, s. 528, sq. (Basel, 1889), and
more forcibly censured by Waitz, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Anthropologie der Naturvölker</cite>, Bd.
I., ss. 84-88. The French school of anthropologists have been especially
one-sided in their devotion to this one element of the science.
Among other great naturalists, Charles Darwin was careful to point
out the variability of the skull as an anatomical part. (<cite>The Descent
of Man</cite>, p. 26.)</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">2</a>
Darwin, <cite>The Descent of Man</cite>, p. 56. The anatomical cause of
elongated or short skulls is the earlier union of either the transverse
or longitudinal sutures, thus forcing the growth to be in the other
direction. (L. Holden, <cite>Human Osteology</cite>, p. 127). Of course, this
begins in fœtal life; and Pruner Bey had observed children with
different forms of the skull born of the same mother. (Oscar Peschel,

This was the result of numerous autopsies during the American

show that the liver of the negro is smaller than that of the white.
(<i>Revue d’Anthropologie</i>, 1887, p. 275). But its relative size to the
lungs is the question at issue. The comparative splanchnology of
the different races has yet to be worked out.</p></div>

One of the leading European students of anatomical racial type
is Dr. J. Kollmann, of Basle. He claims that there are four fundamental
skull types in that continent:</p>

<p>1. Narrow faced, brachycephalic.<br />
2. Narrow faced, dolichocephalic.<br />
3. Broad faced, brachycephalic.<br />
4. Broad faced, dolichocephalic.</p>

<p>These forms he believes have been steadily perpetuated and have
undergone no change, except by intermarrying; they bear no relation
to intellectual ability, and they recur in nations of the same language,
customs and history. “Ethnic unity in Europe rests not
upon racial identity, but racial (anatomical) diversity.” <i>Verhand. der

In offering this new derivation of the much discussed name
Berberi or Barbari, one must remember that it has always been the
name of a powerful tribe in Morocco, the Brebres; that it was what
the ancient Egyptians called them (Herodotus); and that it is to-day
a pure Libyan word. <i>Iberru</i>, is from the verbal root <i>ibra</i>, they
are free; <i>ibarbar</i>, they come forth (Newman, <i>Libyan Vocabulary</i>, pp.
40, 133). The plural in the Hamitic group was originally formed by
repetition (F. Müller, <i>Sprachwissenschaft</i>, Bd. III., s. 240). Hence
Berberi may mean either “those who came forth,” <i>i. e.</i>, emigrants,
or those who go where they list, <i>i. e.</i>, freemen. This is also the
meaning of <i>amóshagh</i>, the generic name of the Touaregs (Barth,
<i>Travels in Africa</i>, vol. v., page 555). Barth, a high authority, believes
that the same word <i>ber</i> is the radical of the names Bernu,
Berdoa, Berauni, etc. The legendary ancestors of the Moroccan
Berbers (Brebres) was Ber, in which, says Barth, “we recognize the
name Afer,” the <i>f</i> and <i>b</i> being interchangeable in these dialects.
From “Afer” we have “Africa” (<i>Travels</i>, vol. i., p. 224). One of
the principal gods of ancient Libya and of the Guanches was Abŏra,
or Ibru. See my article “On Etruscan and Libyan Names” in <i>Proceedings
of the American Philosophical Society</i>, Feb., 1890. One of
the Pindaric fragments recites a Libyan tradition to the effect that
the first man, Iarbas, sprang from the sun-heated soil, and chose for
food the sweet acorns of the tree (Lenormant, <i>The Beginnings of
History</i>, p. 48). In “Iarbas” we can scarcely fail in recognizing the
same root <i>bar</i>, the change being by the familiar process of reversal.</p></div>

Early in this century, Bory de St. Vincent maintained the identity
of the Iberians and Berbers (<i>Essai Geologique</i>, Paris, 1805). Humboldt
argued that there was but one language in old Spain beside the
Celtic, in spite of the direct assertion of Strabo to the contrary, and
the well-known fact that many Celtiberic inscriptions cannot be read
either in Celtic or Basque (<i>Prüfung der Untersuchungen</i>, etc., § 39).
</p>
<p>
The Roman geographer, Rufus Festus Avienus, offers the important
correction that the Iberi derived their name, not from the Ebro,
as is usually stated, but from a stream close to Gibraltar on the Atlantic
side.</p>

To Prof. A. H. Sayce is, I think, due the honor of showing that
the pre-Semitic white race of Palestine was of the Libyan stock. See
<i>Nature</i>, 1888, p. 321. He had previously pointed out that the two
forms of tenses of the Libyan verb “correspond most remarkably
with Assyrian forms” (<i>Introduction to the Science of Language</i>, Vol.
II., p. 180). Rawlinson, in his <i>Story of Phenicia</i> (N. Y., 1889), adopts
the view that the early Phenicians were Hamites. The epochal discovery
of Halevy, now accepted by Delitzsch and other Assyriologists,
that the “second” column of the cuneiform inscription is merely
a Hamito-Semitic dialect in another character, finally destroys the
“Turanian” hypothesis, and restores the ancient Assyrians to the
Eurafrican race.</p></div>

authority of Maury; but Fr. Müller thinks the analogies “too weak”
to be convincing. (<i>Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft.</i> Bd. II., s.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
